SCHANER: Good morning.,00:00:22.440,00:00:23.820
"I've been given the honor
of introducing our speaker.",00:00:23.820,00:00:26.970
"My name is Simon Schaner,
and I'm a PhD candidate",00:00:26.970,00:00:29.820
in the Department of Economics.,00:00:29.820,00:00:32.100
"Earlier this morning,
several of us students",00:00:32.100,00:00:34.170
"were privileged to show Mr.
Gates examples of our research.",00:00:34.170,00:00:38.100
"Mine focuses on the use of
malaria diagnostic tests",00:00:38.100,00:00:41.400
"and anti malarials among
low-income households",00:00:41.400,00:00:43.620
in Africa.,00:00:43.620,00:00:45.180
"Public health issues
such as malaria",00:00:45.180,00:00:47.160
"are among the many problems
tackled by the Bill and Melinda",00:00:47.160,00:00:49.980
"Gates Foundation in a quest
to help all people lead",00:00:49.980,00:00:53.220
healthy and productive lives.,00:00:53.220,00:00:55.710
"At MIT, we share the
foundation's ambition",00:00:55.710,00:00:58.350
"to confront big problems
with big solutions,",00:00:58.350,00:01:01.380
"as we pursue our mission to
serve the nation and the world.",00:01:01.380,00:01:05.160
"Mr. Gates has long been a
friend to the Institute,",00:01:05.160,00:01:07.560
"and his work toward the
betterment of humankind",00:01:07.560,00:01:09.840
continues to inspire us.,00:01:09.840,00:01:12.090
"We are honored that he
was chosen to visit us",00:01:12.090,00:01:14.400
as part of his college tour.,00:01:14.400,00:01:16.470
Please welcome Bill Gates.,00:01:16.470,00:01:17.660
[APPLAUSE],00:01:17.660,00:01:19.644
GATES: Thank you.,00:01:21.628,00:01:22.620
Thank you.,00:01:31.010,00:01:31.510
Well it's great to be here.,00:01:36.360,00:01:38.690
"When I dropped out of college,
I promised my dad I'd go back,",00:01:38.690,00:01:43.550
"and so I'm doing it a
day at a time to work off",00:01:43.550,00:01:47.360
that debt that I've got.,00:01:47.360,00:01:50.880
"This is the first
college set of visits",00:01:50.880,00:01:54.930
"I've done since switching to
work full time for the Gates",00:01:54.930,00:01:59.940
Foundation.,00:01:59.940,00:02:01.500
"And it's a little bit
different than the kind",00:02:01.500,00:02:06.120
"of talks I gave when
I was coming out",00:02:06.120,00:02:09.690
"focused on software,
focused on Microsoft.",00:02:09.690,00:02:12.630
"I'll talk a bit about
technology and how",00:02:12.630,00:02:14.400
"it's an enabling
factor, but mostly, I",00:02:14.400,00:02:17.130
"want to talk about a
question that fascinates me",00:02:17.130,00:02:22.080
"and that is are the
brightest minds working",00:02:22.080,00:02:25.470
on the most important problems?,00:02:25.470,00:02:28.600
"And to the degree
that they're not,",00:02:28.600,00:02:31.210
"how could we increase
that, which I think",00:02:31.210,00:02:34.240
would make a huge difference.,00:02:34.240,00:02:36.690
"Now this is a question
that we'd like",00:02:36.690,00:02:39.130
"to be as precise
as possible, but I",00:02:39.130,00:02:41.050
"think it'll be tough to
be too numeric on it.",00:02:41.050,00:02:44.090
"After all, if we
think about what do we",00:02:44.090,00:02:46.690
mean by the brightest minds?,00:02:46.690,00:02:50.620
"You could have a range
of definitions of that,",00:02:50.620,00:02:53.320
"but I think any
definition would include",00:02:53.320,00:02:56.560
"the people who get to attend
the world's top 20 universities.",00:02:56.560,00:03:01.660
"And so everyone here would
fit into that category.",00:03:01.660,00:03:08.590
"Also, if we take a phrase
like important problems,",00:03:08.590,00:03:11.720
"I think there would
be a different lists",00:03:11.720,00:03:13.450
that people would come up with.,00:03:13.450,00:03:15.490
"I think there's some things
that would be in common.",00:03:15.490,00:03:18.260
"The problems in poor countries,
the health problems, sanitation",00:03:18.260,00:03:22.330
"problems, governance
problems, inability",00:03:22.330,00:03:25.930
"to do savings, get loans,
all of those problems that",00:03:25.930,00:03:29.950
"make life so much more difficult
for the bottom 2 billion,",00:03:29.950,00:03:34.300
"versus particularly,
the richest 1 billion",00:03:34.300,00:03:37.690
would belong on that list.,00:03:37.690,00:03:39.040
"And there'd be five or
six really big things",00:03:39.040,00:03:41.680
"that we haven't put
enough attention into that",00:03:41.680,00:03:45.790
would make a huge difference.,00:03:45.790,00:03:47.293
"We'd also have in the
list, some problems that",00:03:47.293,00:03:49.210
are more global in nature.,00:03:49.210,00:03:51.530
"For example, the
problem of education.",00:03:51.530,00:03:54.650
"It's not something that even
the world's richest country,",00:03:54.650,00:03:57.670
"the United States,
has managed to improve",00:03:57.670,00:04:01.180
"and make equitable and
make available to everybody",00:04:01.180,00:04:04.590
who should want it.,00:04:04.590,00:04:06.070
"Or we'd have the
problem of energy,",00:04:06.070,00:04:08.260
"where getting energy to
be lower and lower cost",00:04:08.260,00:04:11.620
"is very important for
everybody, and now we",00:04:11.620,00:04:14.463
"have a new constraint
that we have",00:04:14.463,00:04:15.880
"to do that in a
way that eliminates",00:04:15.880,00:04:18.760
"the environmental negative
effects, including that CO2",00:04:18.760,00:04:22.089
emission.,00:04:22.089,00:04:24.140
"You might have on the
list the difficulty",00:04:24.140,00:04:26.710
"of feeding the world,
where you don't",00:04:26.710,00:04:28.630
"have much more acreage you can
put under cultivation, and yet",00:04:28.630,00:04:32.500
"both the population
increase, a factor of 1.5,",00:04:32.500,00:04:36.070
"and the dietary change you
get as people get richer",00:04:36.070,00:04:39.400
"mean that we're going to
have to have about three",00:04:39.400,00:04:41.920
"times the agricultural
output and the only trick",00:04:41.920,00:04:46.000
"that we have for that is
increased productivity.",00:04:46.000,00:04:48.280
"And so a huge
challenge, also one",00:04:48.280,00:04:52.540
"with significant
environmental constraints.",00:04:52.540,00:04:56.230
"So those are the kinds of things
I think about when I think",00:04:56.230,00:05:00.970
about the important problems.,00:05:00.970,00:05:02.710
"And for many of these problems,
the amount of work that's",00:05:02.710,00:05:06.460
"been done on very
essential questions,",00:05:06.460,00:05:09.340
"it always stuns me
how few bright minds",00:05:09.340,00:05:12.403
have worked on those things.,00:05:12.403,00:05:13.570
"How little effort and
energy and investigation",00:05:13.570,00:05:17.050
"there is on those
things, and it makes",00:05:17.050,00:05:19.150
"me wonder how we
might change that.",00:05:19.150,00:05:22.090
"How we might make these
things more exciting.",00:05:22.090,00:05:25.350
I was thinking about this.,00:05:25.350,00:05:26.640
"About three weeks ago, I
was with some friends just",00:05:26.640,00:05:29.820
"goofing around on the weekend,
and they had a couple topics",00:05:29.820,00:05:33.960
"that their incredible minds
had really focused on,",00:05:33.960,00:05:38.340
"and were thinking in
this rich, deep way,",00:05:38.340,00:05:41.970
"where they knew the history,
they knew the strategies,",00:05:41.970,00:05:44.430
they know the outputs.,00:05:44.430,00:05:47.040
"The two topics were
first, NCAA March Madness",00:05:47.040,00:05:53.040
"and what was going to
happen in basketball.",00:05:53.040,00:05:55.853
"I don't remember
anyone mentioning",00:05:55.853,00:05:57.270
"them MIT team in those
discussions, but that's okay.",00:05:57.270,00:06:03.990
"And they really had
studied these problems.",00:06:03.990,00:06:08.190
"They had those
brackets and they were",00:06:08.190,00:06:09.870
"talking about which was going to
be best and a wonderful debate",00:06:09.870,00:06:14.040
about those topics.,00:06:14.040,00:06:16.150
"And the second thing was
discussing of investments.",00:06:16.150,00:06:20.760
"Who had pick good stocks, what
had happened in the mortgage",00:06:20.760,00:06:23.670
"market, what was going to happen
with the investment banks,",00:06:23.670,00:06:26.700
"what kind of derivatives were
there, and did various people",00:06:26.700,00:06:29.160
"understand what you
might choose to do",00:06:29.160,00:06:33.060
in investing in those things.,00:06:33.060,00:06:34.440
"And all that IQ,
including lots of IQ",00:06:34.440,00:06:38.040
"that goes off to Wall Street
and just works on those topics",00:06:38.040,00:06:42.900
is there full time thing.,00:06:42.900,00:06:44.790
"So we have lots of talent
that could be shifted,",00:06:44.790,00:06:48.900
"at least to some degree,
from sports, entertainment,",00:06:48.900,00:06:53.970
"investing, even in the
areas of innovation,",00:06:53.970,00:06:57.370
"a great science that's it's
done here and other places.",00:06:57.370,00:07:01.210
"A lot of that focuses on
the needs of the rich.",00:07:01.210,00:07:04.240
"There's a lot of great
work on baldness drugs.",00:07:04.240,00:07:08.760
"Now, I'm not talking
about a complete shift,",00:07:08.760,00:07:11.850
"because I still want to have
some movies, I like movies,",00:07:11.850,00:07:15.780
"and I certainly know people
that would be easier to look at",00:07:15.780,00:07:20.100
if they'd use the baldness drug.,00:07:20.100,00:07:23.840
"But how could we have
a shift of, both people",00:07:23.840,00:07:29.960
"who work on these issues
on a full time basis,",00:07:29.960,00:07:34.130
"and perhaps even more
importantly, people",00:07:34.130,00:07:36.920
"who although it's not
their full time focus,",00:07:36.920,00:07:39.758
"that they're engaged
in these things.",00:07:39.758,00:07:41.300
"They picked one or two, and
their time, their donation,",00:07:41.300,00:07:46.190
"their political voice is
involved in these things.",00:07:46.190,00:07:51.140
"I think if you look at the trend
over the last 15 years or so,",00:07:51.140,00:07:55.760
"there has been an increase,
and places like MIT",00:07:55.760,00:07:59.840
"have been very good in
taking leadership on this.",00:07:59.840,00:08:03.120
"If you look at the visibility
of issues like malaria and AIDS,",00:08:03.120,00:08:07.100
"it is much higher today
than any time in the past.",00:08:07.100,00:08:10.940
"And that is resulting in
more government donations,",00:08:10.940,00:08:14.480
"more scientists working
on those things.",00:08:14.480,00:08:16.460
"Still, if you take malaria,
it's a pretty small set.",00:08:16.460,00:08:19.790
"There's less than 100
scientists who work",00:08:19.790,00:08:22.820
on the key problems of malaria.,00:08:22.820,00:08:24.710
"Kills a million children a year,
should it have more than that,",00:08:24.710,00:08:30.470
maybe so.,00:08:30.470,00:08:33.000
So we've seen a change.,00:08:33.000,00:08:34.750
"My generation was not
that aware of poverty",00:08:34.750,00:08:38.163
and what was going on.,00:08:38.163,00:08:39.080
"I don't know whether
it was the Cold War",00:08:39.080,00:08:40.747
"or what the distraction was, but
it was not as visible, not as",00:08:40.747,00:08:48.300
clear as it starting to be.,00:08:48.300,00:08:50.800
"Now I see this
shift in many ways.",00:08:50.800,00:08:52.920
"I see it in terms of what the
students here are going into,",00:08:52.920,00:08:58.080
"I have a project up in Seattle,
which is about using software",00:08:58.080,00:09:01.710
to model diseases.,00:09:01.710,00:09:03.950
"And a MIT graduate,
[INAUDIBLE] is working on that.",00:09:03.950,00:09:10.630
"And she could make 10
times as much money",00:09:10.630,00:09:13.590
"working on something else, but
this idea of modeling malaria,",00:09:13.590,00:09:17.320
"and other diseases, and
testing out the tactics",00:09:17.320,00:09:19.680
"and using actually this
Monte Carlo simulation, which",00:09:19.680,00:09:22.620
"is a technique from
physics applying it",00:09:22.620,00:09:24.390
to that in this very rich way.,00:09:24.390,00:09:26.990
"Now, that problem
has drawn her in,",00:09:26.990,00:09:29.310
"and we've got this team of
amazing people doing that.",00:09:29.310,00:09:34.650
We have some exemplars.,00:09:34.650,00:09:35.760
"People like Paul
Farmer, who people",00:09:35.760,00:09:37.980
"aspire to do the kind of work
that he does, and it's not just",00:09:37.980,00:09:43.710
"the global issues, also on
education and Teach for America",00:09:43.710,00:09:47.680
is a new phenomena.,00:09:47.680,00:09:49.530
"Here at MIT, there were 96
people in the graduating class",00:09:49.530,00:09:53.850
"who applied for
Teach for America,",00:09:53.850,00:09:55.650
"and that's 7.5% of the class,
and that's pretty amazing,",00:09:55.650,00:09:59.770
"because every one
of those kids would",00:09:59.770,00:10:01.380
"have had other opportunities
that would have been far more",00:10:01.380,00:10:05.130
renumeration.,00:10:05.130,00:10:06.360
"So there is this
increased visibility.",00:10:06.360,00:10:10.680
"I myself, did not go through
some rational process",00:10:10.680,00:10:14.130
"of picking what I
wanted to work on",00:10:14.130,00:10:16.740
"based on either economics or
it ranking high on some list",00:10:16.740,00:10:22.050
I wrote down great problems.,00:10:22.050,00:10:24.240
"I fell into what I ended up
doing as my full time career.",00:10:24.240,00:10:29.080
"I was 13, there was computer,
it confused the teachers,",00:10:29.080,00:10:33.990
"it was fun to figure
it out, and that",00:10:33.990,00:10:36.090
"became my fanatical
involvement, was thinking,",00:10:36.090,00:10:40.050
how could software improve?,00:10:40.050,00:10:41.250
How could it be better?,00:10:41.250,00:10:42.300
"Trying to meet people
who had done more",00:10:42.300,00:10:45.060
"and getting them to
critique what I'd done.",00:10:45.060,00:10:46.890
"And then eventually, starting
a company around that idea.",00:10:46.890,00:10:51.450
"And I feel good that you can
say through happenstance,",00:10:51.450,00:10:55.470
"that work actually led
to a broad industry,",00:10:55.470,00:11:00.150
"personal computing,
internet, software, that",00:11:00.150,00:11:03.060
has been incredibly empowering.,00:11:03.060,00:11:05.970
"Has had, both in a
direct sense, but also",00:11:05.970,00:11:08.850
"as a tool to be used for
these other problems,",00:11:08.850,00:11:11.520
it has been fantastic.,00:11:11.520,00:11:13.420
"And so I don't look back
on that with any regret.",00:11:13.420,00:11:17.150
"It what it did work out, but I
didn't know what was going on",00:11:17.150,00:11:21.990
in the world I was in my 40s.,00:11:21.990,00:11:23.730
"Before in terms of
my travels, I started",00:11:23.730,00:11:26.280
"really having an
awareness of how",00:11:26.280,00:11:28.530

heard of called rotavirus that",00:11:37.500,00:11:40.350

half a million kids a year--,00:11:42.120,00:11:44.310
"and thinking, well,
boy, there must be a lot",00:11:44.310,00:11:46.320
of scientists working on that.,00:11:46.320,00:11:48.450
"One fact, at that time,
there are about 10 scientists",00:11:48.450,00:11:51.090

just an obvious thing.",00:11:51.980,00:11:57.100

world is not that rational.",00:11:57.100,00:11:59.670

news for me, personally,",00:12:02.850,00:12:05.250

some very clear things",00:12:05.250,00:12:07.380

the Microsoft resources",00:12:07.380,00:12:09.660

fruit that hadn't been picked.",00:12:12.700,00:12:15.300
I wasn't going to be--,00:12:15.300,00:12:17.120

two problems, including",00:12:26.410,00:12:28.410
"that one of childhood deaths,
and talk about what's going on,",00:12:28.410,00:12:32.170

need more bright minds,",00:12:32.170,00:12:35.850

deep need on many of these,",00:12:35.850,00:12:40.050

have very strongly, even if you",00:12:48.360,00:12:52.510

the number of childhood deaths.",00:12:52.510,00:12:56.470

effort now that we've",00:12:56.470,00:12:58.312

Development Goals,",00:12:58.312,00:13:00.270

where different countries are",00:13:00.270,00:13:03.580

fairly ambitious goals",00:13:03.580,00:13:06.220

is this under five",00:13:07.660,00:13:10.300
"childhood death number,
and the milestone",00:13:10.300,00:13:13.630
"for those goals
as 2015, and we'll",00:13:13.630,00:13:15.550
make pretty good progress.,00:13:15.550,00:13:17.242
"We want to achieve
them all, but it",00:13:17.242,00:13:18.700
has had a very positive effect.,00:13:18.700,00:13:22.520
"So this is a very
interesting metric,",00:13:22.520,00:13:25.840

show you one, but it's",00:13:28.930,00:13:31.030

the world, and that's",00:13:31.030,00:13:34.030

progress over time",00:13:34.030,00:13:36.670
"in reducing these
childhood deaths.",00:13:36.670,00:13:39.190

over 20 million children",00:13:39.190,00:13:41.950

"If you come up to
the last year, which",00:13:44.830,00:13:46.930
"was the most recent
measurement we have on this,",00:13:46.930,00:13:50.500
it was under 9 million children.,00:13:50.500,00:13:53.200
"And there's about a 40% increase
in the size of the birth",00:13:53.200,00:13:57.580
"cohort, so the actual
rate reduction you've got",00:13:57.580,00:14:00.430
"is actually even better
than the factor of two",00:14:00.430,00:14:02.950
"you see here in the
absolute number.",00:14:02.950,00:14:05.050

how did that happen?",00:14:05.050,00:14:06.800
What is it?,00:14:06.800,00:14:08.680
Is it cancer drugs?,00:14:08.680,00:14:12.400
What kind of science did it?,00:14:12.400,00:14:14.810
"And the answer is
although some of it",00:14:14.810,00:14:16.390
"is just nutrition and income
levels, the general advance",00:14:16.390,00:14:19.720

living conditions you're under.",00:14:19.720,00:14:24.460

that is vaccines.",00:14:24.460,00:14:29.770

a million of that reduction.",00:14:29.770,00:14:33.520

that led actually",00:14:33.520,00:14:36.310
"to the first
eradication of a disease",00:14:36.310,00:14:39.040

part of this reduction.",00:14:39.040,00:14:41.740
"Well over a million
death reduction",00:14:41.740,00:14:44.500
per year because of that.,00:14:44.500,00:14:46.490
"And so vaccines,
which get less than 1%",00:14:46.490,00:14:50.440

spending, goes into that area.",00:14:50.440,00:14:54.550

a really incredible amount",00:14:54.550,00:14:59.620

a underappreciated element",00:15:00.460,00:15:07.750
of why things work.,00:15:07.750,00:15:08.650

trained medical personnel",00:15:15.100,00:15:17.830
to do it.,00:15:17.830,00:15:18.720

Somalia, where you essentially,",00:15:18.720,00:15:21.190
"have no government, we have
quite high vaccination rates.",00:15:21.190,00:15:25.090

we have in northern Nigeria,",00:15:25.090,00:15:27.560

a dysfunctional vaccination",00:15:27.560,00:15:32.050

30% in some of those areas.",00:15:32.050,00:15:37.370

to fix, while at the same time,",00:15:37.370,00:15:41.560

you before 20% of you had died?",00:15:59.260,00:16:06.350

four before 20% had died.",00:16:17.170,00:16:21.010

dramatic difference.",00:16:21.010,00:16:23.860

when I found out about this",00:16:23.860,00:16:28.930

biggest intervention",00:17:15.010,00:17:19.150

countries with terrible health,",00:17:39.760,00:17:43.540

this effect is",00:17:47.700,00:17:50.660

large a family size.",00:17:58.610,00:18:03.060

you start to improve health,",00:18:03.060,00:18:06.450

become tractable,",00:18:06.450,00:18:08.480

is education.,00:19:10.140,00:19:11.970

college level,",00:19:22.130,00:19:24.680

way is the thing",00:19:24.680,00:19:27.200

improve its standard of living.",00:19:27.200,00:19:31.830
"So both that at macro level, but
also at the individual level.",00:19:31.830,00:19:35.770
"We all know from our
personal experience",00:19:35.770,00:19:37.670
"that education is what makes
our life interesting, gives us",00:19:37.670,00:19:40.910
"opportunity, and
so we should want",00:19:40.910,00:19:43.070
it to be broadly available.,00:19:43.070,00:19:45.690
"If you look-- and I was
absolutely blown away",00:19:45.690,00:19:48.570
"at the statistics, I had no
idea of how poorly the education",00:19:48.570,00:19:53.220
system in the US is working.,00:19:53.220,00:19:55.530
"Over 30% of kids drop
out of high school.",00:19:55.530,00:19:58.380

50% drop out of high school.",00:19:58.380,00:20:03.000

complete, many of them",00:20:03.000,00:20:05.790
"have had a really,
really poor education.",00:20:05.790,00:20:08.800
"And so they sign up
for college, they",00:20:08.800,00:20:11.250
"get into a remedial math
class, and half of those kids",00:20:11.250,00:20:14.130
never get any degree.,00:20:14.130,00:20:16.093

they're paying off,",00:20:16.093,00:20:17.760

negative experience,",00:20:17.760,00:20:19.500
"they put time into it, and it
hasn't worked for them at all.",00:20:19.500,00:20:24.070
"And so this education
system is quite poor,",00:20:24.070,00:20:27.720
"and it's been covered up,
hasn't been that visible.",00:20:27.720,00:20:33.600
"What we have now is a trend
that because of the way",00:20:33.600,00:20:36.270
"state budgets are allocated,
a great education is going",00:20:36.270,00:20:39.960
"to be more and more
out of reach, that is,",00:20:39.960,00:20:42.960
the tuition is more expensive.,00:20:42.960,00:20:44.320

situation where less people are",00:20:44.320,00:20:48.540

educations unless we",00:20:48.540,00:20:51.030

"So I'd say there's two things
that are very important.",00:20:58.290,00:21:03.400
"One is to take the
quality of teaching,",00:21:03.400,00:21:05.940
"and this is particularly
in K through 12,",00:21:05.940,00:21:08.250
"and find out what the
best practices are,",00:21:08.250,00:21:10.840
"and how to spread
those best practices.",00:21:10.840,00:21:13.020
"And it blows my
mind how little work",00:21:13.020,00:21:15.450
"has been done on
that to identify, now",00:21:15.450,00:21:17.670
"that we know some teachers
are wildly better than most",00:21:17.670,00:21:20.730
"teachers, you make over two
years of progress in math",00:21:20.730,00:21:23.550
"if you get a top
quartile teacher,",00:21:23.550,00:21:25.590

quartile teacher.",00:21:27.400,00:21:30.450

Is it seniority?,00:21:32.190,00:21:33.410
We know it's not.,00:21:33.410,00:21:34.950
Is it having a PhD in math?,00:21:34.950,00:21:36.525

it's not that either.",00:21:36.525,00:21:38.150

are focused on it.",00:21:40.830,00:21:42.690

the kids are being drawn in,",00:21:42.690,00:21:46.290
and yet we don't study that.,00:21:46.290,00:21:48.960
"We don't invest in
spreading it around.",00:21:48.960,00:21:51.850
"We don't measure teachers,
give them feedback,",00:21:51.850,00:21:53.970
"it's a system, where there's
a huge opportunity to improve,",00:21:53.970,00:21:58.710
so that's important.,00:21:58.710,00:22:00.260
"And the other thing I
think is using technology.",00:22:00.260,00:22:03.400
"And here's a case where
MIT has absolutely",00:22:03.400,00:22:06.450
been at the forefront.,00:22:06.450,00:22:08.190
"OpenCourseWare,
there's great numbers",00:22:08.190,00:22:10.650
"in terms of how much it's being
used by millions of people.",00:22:10.650,00:22:14.730
I'm a super happy user.,00:22:14.730,00:22:17.320
"I retook physics
with Walter Lewin,",00:22:17.320,00:22:19.500

course and loved that.",00:22:19.500,00:22:23.710

for me, it's a good thing.",00:22:39.600,00:22:44.890

the high bar of why",00:26:44.200,00:26:47.950

the technology, but also",00:28:19.540,00:28:22.420

"Results of a survey rewrite,
we recently distributed",00:28:45.790,00:28:49.030

office revealed",00:28:49.030,00:28:52.030

engaged in some global health",00:28:52.030,00:28:56.080

have an interest in this area.",00:28:56.080,00:29:01.070

[LAUGHTER],00:29:22.210,00:29:23.500
"--would you be supportive of
a centralized administrative",00:29:23.500,00:29:26.830
"led initiative, committed
to supporting global health",00:29:26.830,00:29:30.370
"at MIT, much like the initiative
that already exists for energy.",00:29:30.370,00:29:35.150
"Two, how do you think
this initiative might",00:29:35.150,00:29:38.230
be implemented?,00:29:38.230,00:29:39.790
"And three, how would
the Gates Foundation",00:29:39.790,00:29:42.520
"be interested in partnering
with such an initiative?",00:29:42.520,00:29:45.750
Thank you.,00:29:45.750,00:29:46.330

definitely applaud",00:29:53.570,00:29:55.520
the work that's going on.,00:29:55.520,00:29:56.940
"And I do think MIT is
an exemplar of this.",00:29:56.940,00:30:02.168
"One of the things
we're trying to get",00:30:02.168,00:30:03.710
"is the institutions in
the developing countries,",00:30:03.710,00:30:07.680
"particularly in Africa and
India, more involved in this",00:30:07.680,00:30:10.940
"and transfer some of the
expertise and skills,",00:30:10.940,00:30:13.160
"so that they, where
the needs are,",00:30:13.160,00:30:18.440
"actually are more
capable of doing",00:30:18.440,00:30:21.410
"some of the elements,
including policy,",00:30:21.410,00:30:23.240
"measurement, things
of that kind.",00:30:23.240,00:30:26.840
"The idea of how
universities organize,",00:30:26.840,00:30:31.060
"now, it's not a deep
expertise that I have,",00:30:31.060,00:30:35.400
"and so the question of whether
there should be a minor",00:30:35.400,00:30:37.690
"or some new thing that
pulls us together,",00:30:37.690,00:30:41.000
"I think that's definitely
worth looking at.",00:30:41.000,00:30:43.430
"I'd encourage you if you do it,
though, to not just take health",00:30:43.430,00:30:47.270
by itself.,00:30:47.270,00:30:48.290
"I'd say broaden it to
international development,",00:30:48.290,00:30:51.350
"because the issues of
agriculture, savings,",00:30:51.350,00:30:57.350
"there's quite a few issues,
and I'd say the awareness",00:30:57.350,00:31:01.670
"and MIT of the health
issues is ahead",00:31:01.670,00:31:04.220
of some of those other issues.,00:31:04.220,00:31:05.570
"And yet, the kind of
expertise is equally",00:31:05.570,00:31:08.930
applicable to those things.,00:31:08.930,00:31:12.090
"And once we improve
health, we still",00:31:12.090,00:31:14.510
want to work on those things.,00:31:14.510,00:31:16.460
"Today, what we've done with MIT
is we take particular projects",00:31:16.460,00:31:19.940
"like the measurement and
evaluation, and we fund that.",00:31:19.940,00:31:25.400
"Bruce Walker does a lot
of the best work on AIDS,",00:31:25.400,00:31:28.490
"and we fund a lot
of his activities.",00:31:28.490,00:31:31.760
"Whether a particular
things should",00:31:31.760,00:31:33.320
"be done at a single
university level here",00:31:33.320,00:31:38.500
"or there's some other
missing thing, I'm not sure.",00:31:38.500,00:31:41.180
"I did see a few
things today where",00:31:41.180,00:31:43.730
"people are doing medical
instruments, where I said,",00:31:43.730,00:31:45.920
"okay, we should make
sure that the needs.",00:31:45.920,00:31:48.950
"What are they using, what are
the problems, what they're",00:31:48.950,00:31:51.350
"using, what is the gap
there that we really",00:31:51.350,00:31:53.630
"do a survey so people are
picking the right thing.",00:31:53.630,00:31:56.430
"So that's a particular
one, but we'll",00:31:56.430,00:31:59.000
"have a dialogue about whether a
minor an Institute makes sense,",00:31:59.000,00:32:03.380
"and whether that's value
added or how that can help.",00:32:03.380,00:32:08.721

MENCHACA: Hi.,00:32:33.938,00:32:34.480
My name is Alejandra Menchaca.,00:32:34.480,00:32:36.670
"I work on energy
efficiency in buildings,",00:32:36.670,00:32:39.460
"and my question has to do
with population growth.",00:32:39.460,00:32:42.400
"In my field, we try to reduce,
or at least where I work on,",00:32:42.400,00:32:46.330
"we're trying to
reduce demand in order",00:32:46.330,00:32:49.240
"that we don't have to work
too hard on the supply side.",00:32:49.240,00:32:54.040
"In terms of population,
it's a hard issue",00:32:54.040,00:32:58.630
"to tell people whether to have
a certain number of kids or not,",00:32:58.630,00:33:02.840
"but clearly, population
growth is clearly",00:33:02.840,00:33:06.040
"a problem, in
terms of supplying,",00:33:06.040,00:33:09.220
"as you mentioned earlier,
the food, and the energy,",00:33:09.220,00:33:12.040
"and everything
staying sustainable.",00:33:12.040,00:33:14.890
"Do you think we will ever get
to a point in which population",00:33:14.890,00:33:19.720
"will be controlled in a
more legal way, or something",00:33:19.720,00:33:26.500
"like that, or it's something
that will never be touched?",00:33:26.500,00:33:28.870
"I know I wouldn't
like to be told,",00:33:28.870,00:33:30.837
"you can't have more than
a certain number of kids,",00:33:30.837,00:33:32.920
"but at the same time,
it is a problem.",00:33:32.920,00:33:34.940
So how do you see that issue?,00:33:34.940,00:33:36.800
"GATES: Yeah, the miracle here.",00:33:36.800,00:33:39.100
"If you go back to
1970, the estimates",00:33:39.100,00:33:42.730
"were that world population
would reach about 20 billion,",00:33:42.730,00:33:46.480
"and that's because people didn't
understand this effect of how",00:33:46.480,00:33:51.850
health would have an impact.,00:33:51.850,00:33:54.680
"And so they lowered
it to 18 to 16 to 14,",00:33:54.680,00:33:57.410
"and now the consensus
is about 9.2 billion",00:33:57.410,00:34:00.490
"peak global population
in about 2050.",00:34:00.490,00:34:04.190
"Now on a global basis,
that's probably okay,",00:34:04.190,00:34:08.370
and we won't do much.,00:34:08.370,00:34:09.489
"Maybe we could get it
to be 8.5 or something,",00:34:09.489,00:34:11.920
"the problem is that population
growth is exactly where we",00:34:11.920,00:34:16.780
have the least resources.,00:34:16.780,00:34:18.217
"The least good government, the
least infrastructure, the least",00:34:18.217,00:34:20.800
"education, the least
food capability, and all",00:34:20.800,00:34:24.760
"of the increase from
the current 6.2 billion",00:34:24.760,00:34:27.670
"that we're at today to that
around 9 billion plus or minus,",00:34:27.670,00:34:32.350
"is going to come in poor
countries in urban cities.",00:34:32.350,00:34:37.270
"That a lot of the births will
be in the rural areas, but net,",00:34:37.270,00:34:40.179
"it's going to be in
these mega cities that",00:34:40.179,00:34:42.699
are somewhat dysfunctional.,00:34:42.699,00:34:45.139
"And so our reproductive
health program",00:34:45.139,00:34:47.860
"is able to substantially
lower birth rates",00:34:47.860,00:34:51.130
"because there's
unmet demand that is,",00:34:51.130,00:34:52.780
"if you just go out to
women and tell them,",00:34:52.780,00:34:54.530
"okay, there's a shot They can
take that works for 90 days,",00:34:54.530,00:35:00.460
"or there's an implant that
works for three years.",00:35:00.460,00:35:03.220
"We're going to be able to bring
the price of those supplies",00:35:03.220,00:35:07.990
down very dramatically.,00:35:07.990,00:35:09.250
"And it's an area that was
ridiculously not funded.",00:35:09.250,00:35:12.760
"In fact, the US
government completely",00:35:12.760,00:35:14.380
"pulled out of the UN population
group because of this issue",00:35:14.380,00:35:18.400
"that some of these groups are
involved in voluntary abortion,",00:35:18.400,00:35:22.060
"and so the US didn't
want to be connected",00:35:22.060,00:35:26.170
in any way with that piece.,00:35:26.170,00:35:28.750
"Now, that rule, the so-called
Mexico City gag rule",00:35:28.750,00:35:30.880
"was eliminated by
President Obama.",00:35:30.880,00:35:34.100
"So for the first
time, the US is back",00:35:34.100,00:35:35.813
"funding some of the
delivery activities.",00:35:35.813,00:35:37.480
"But the innovation here,
there's a lot that can be done.",00:35:37.480,00:35:40.870
"As you bring the price of these
things down, the injections,",00:35:40.870,00:35:43.900
"the implants, as you get the
word out, the demand is there.",00:35:43.900,00:35:47.320
"So it's all
completely voluntary.",00:35:47.320,00:35:50.170
"Women want to have a
smaller family in all",00:35:50.170,00:35:55.810
"of these high
population growth areas,",00:35:55.810,00:35:57.880
"and so there's no need to
worry about coercive things.",00:35:57.880,00:36:03.520
"In fact, back in the 60s,
the Club of Rome people",00:36:03.520,00:36:07.630
"who were these doom
and gloom people",00:36:07.630,00:36:09.700
"we're saying that we had to
have coercive techniques,",00:36:09.700,00:36:12.190
and they just didn't understand.,00:36:12.190,00:36:14.930
"So you have a very
positive view of this.",00:36:14.930,00:36:19.600
"People want to have
smaller families,",00:36:19.600,00:36:22.090
"the advances are coming
that will make that easier.",00:36:22.090,00:36:25.960
"It won't come soon enough
in a way, take Tanzania,",00:36:25.960,00:36:28.870
"it's a population
of 42 million now.",00:36:28.870,00:36:30.970
"Even with a modest birth
rate, it'll get to 90 million",00:36:30.970,00:36:34.060
"because they have the
age structure as such,",00:36:34.060,00:36:36.440
"you have all these
young people, that when",00:36:36.440,00:36:38.200
"they go and have their
children, will all about double",00:36:38.200,00:36:41.410
the population.,00:36:41.410,00:36:42.920
"One of the ironies in population
is that the rich countries",00:36:42.920,00:36:45.580
are shrinking.,00:36:45.580,00:36:46.630
"The US is the only rich country
that has population growth.",00:36:46.630,00:36:51.370
"Japan, Italy, Germany
are shrinking.",00:36:51.370,00:36:54.910
"Mexico, even at their
middle income level,",00:36:54.910,00:36:57.880
is actually shrinking.,00:36:57.880,00:37:00.040
"And yet, you think, oh, we
should have more immigration.",00:37:00.040,00:37:03.400
"We should take all
these young people",00:37:03.400,00:37:06.550
"and keep our age
structure reasonable,",00:37:06.550,00:37:08.700
"but politically, that's
fairly difficult to do.",00:37:08.700,00:37:13.030
"Even in India, this
is an amazing thing,",00:37:13.030,00:37:15.220
"in the south of India in
Kerala there below, which",00:37:15.220,00:37:18.430
"is the part of India with
really good health care,",00:37:18.430,00:37:22.130
"it's subjectively the
best, they're actually",00:37:22.130,00:37:24.280
"below replacement rate,
whereas, in the same country",00:37:24.280,00:37:26.920
"you go up to Uttar Pradesh,
that's 3.5% growth year, so one",00:37:26.920,00:37:30.610
"of the highest population
growth in the entire world.",00:37:30.610,00:37:33.740
"The two highest
population growth areas",00:37:33.740,00:37:35.440
"are actually northern
Nigeria, northern India,",00:37:35.440,00:37:37.490
"which is also where you
don't have good vaccination.",00:37:37.490,00:37:40.040
"And so in a way, it's
good news because you",00:37:40.040,00:37:42.250
"do the interventions with
the reproductive health",00:37:42.250,00:37:45.010
"and the vaccines and
the childhood care",00:37:45.010,00:37:47.380
"all in the same places,
and it's very focused",00:37:47.380,00:37:50.710
where you go and do that work.,00:37:50.710,00:37:54.193
BRYAN: My name's Alan Bryan.,00:37:54.193,00:37:55.360
"I am in the Health
Sciences and Technology.",00:37:55.360,00:37:57.740
I have a PhD in Bioinformatics.,00:37:57.740,00:37:59.748
"I'm a medical student,
and so I'm now going",00:37:59.748,00:38:01.540
to work in medical informatics.,00:38:01.540,00:38:03.460
"My question is single,
but with two applications.",00:38:03.460,00:38:07.210
"You spoke of particularly
vaccines and an improving",00:38:07.210,00:38:10.810
education methods.,00:38:10.810,00:38:13.120
"In both, there's a
two-part problem.",00:38:13.120,00:38:16.000
"One, is how to find
what works better,",00:38:16.000,00:38:19.360
"and the second is how to get
what works better out to people",00:38:19.360,00:38:23.590
who need it.,00:38:23.590,00:38:25.870
"In both cases, which
do you find harder?",00:38:25.870,00:38:28.310
"So for vaccines, is
it harder, and this",00:38:28.310,00:38:31.480
"is based on your past experience
talking to people and then",00:38:31.480,00:38:34.670
their future projections.,00:38:34.670,00:38:37.120
"Is it harder to do the
research to find the vaccine,",00:38:37.120,00:38:41.290
"or to establish the cold chain
that gets it out to people.",00:38:41.290,00:38:44.590
"And likewise, in
education reform,",00:38:44.590,00:38:48.800
"is it harder to figure out
what best practices really",00:38:48.800,00:38:52.310
"are that are
transferable and are not",00:38:52.310,00:38:54.920
"innate to some organization,
or some teacher's",00:38:54.920,00:39:00.050
"personal patterns of
action or something.",00:39:00.050,00:39:03.860
"Or is it harder to talk through
the accreditation process,",00:39:03.860,00:39:07.640
"and schools of education,
departments of education,",00:39:07.640,00:39:10.250
"so forth, to get it
integrated into the system?",00:39:10.250,00:39:12.692
"GATES: Yeah, that's
a very good question.",00:39:12.692,00:39:14.400
"And the answer is different
for the two different domains.",00:39:14.400,00:39:17.690
"In the case of vaccines,
we are science limited.",00:39:17.690,00:39:21.740
"That is, an AIDS
vaccine is very tricky",00:39:21.740,00:39:24.460
"and we're having to learn basic
things about molecular shape",00:39:24.460,00:39:27.800
"space, immunology,
it is interesting,",00:39:27.800,00:39:33.590
"but it's taking us a lot longer
because we haven't gotten lucky",00:39:33.590,00:39:37.040
on that one.,00:39:37.040,00:39:38.180
So that is science limited.,00:39:38.180,00:39:39.320
"Malaria vaccine it's
criminal that we didn't",00:39:39.320,00:39:41.930
"work on it, because probably
the science of the 80s or 90s",00:39:41.930,00:39:45.620
"were good enough to
do a malaria vaccine.",00:39:45.620,00:39:47.570
"They were not good enough
to know an AIDS vaccine.",00:39:47.570,00:39:49.910
"Even if we'd been
working super hard,",00:39:49.910,00:39:52.218
"we just don't have the
fundamental understanding.",00:39:52.218,00:39:54.260
"Most of the diseases we work on,
the vaccines aren't that hard,",00:39:54.260,00:39:58.442
"it's just there wasn't
money put into it,",00:39:58.442,00:40:00.150
"and so now it's moving
at full speed now.",00:40:00.150,00:40:03.312
"And the delivery
thing, we're going",00:40:03.312,00:40:04.770
"to have to raise
money, billions,",00:40:04.770,00:40:06.890
"but you're talking about saving
lives for less than $2,000",00:40:06.890,00:40:11.240
"invested that is funding
vaccination it saves",00:40:11.240,00:40:15.410
"lives for less than $2,000.",00:40:15.410,00:40:16.950
"And because in the US we'll
spend $2 million or $20 million",00:40:16.950,00:40:22.490
"to save a life,
then you say, okay,",00:40:22.490,00:40:24.740
"are these lives really less
than 1,000 times as valuable?",00:40:24.740,00:40:30.000
"I mean, maybe there
are 400 as valuable,",00:40:30.000,00:40:31.790
"but 1,000, that's
getting kind of extreme.",00:40:31.790,00:40:34.040
"I mean, even in
the Constitution,",00:40:34.040,00:40:37.070
slaves were worth what?,00:40:37.070,00:40:38.120
"3/5 of the vote or
something like that.",00:40:38.120,00:40:40.380
"So in terms of
discrimination, numerically,",00:40:40.380,00:40:43.550
"this is pretty extreme stuff if
you fail to fund the vaccines,",00:40:43.550,00:40:47.157
"which right now, in
the budget crisis,",00:40:47.157,00:40:48.740
"we're having challenges with
that, but in the long run,",00:40:48.740,00:40:50.390
we won't.,00:40:50.390,00:40:51.410
"On cold chain, there's
this great science",00:40:51.410,00:40:54.710
"of these super thermoses
that should avoid us having",00:40:54.710,00:40:57.920
"to use electrification, which
is very tough because if it goes",00:40:57.920,00:41:02.210
"out, the vaccines spoils,
and electricity policies",00:41:02.210,00:41:05.150
"in these countries are so bad
that using a solution that's",00:41:05.150,00:41:11.450
"passive energy to get the
cold basically ice in a super",00:41:11.450,00:41:16.300
"or in a Dewar's
type thing, we think",00:41:16.300,00:41:19.580
we can replace cold chain.,00:41:19.580,00:41:20.920
"But even if we have to use
refrigerators, we can do it.",00:41:20.920,00:41:23.480

vaccines because of the fact",00:41:23.480,00:41:27.530
"that some of the
most will spoil.",00:41:27.530,00:41:29.390
So that one is science limited.,00:41:29.390,00:41:30.900
"The education one, even
though we don't know--",00:41:30.900,00:41:34.630
"it's mind blowing
how little we know",00:41:34.630,00:41:36.380
"about what good
teachers do and how",00:41:36.380,00:41:38.270
"you would invest in
spreading that around, I",00:41:38.270,00:41:40.160

some good work going on.",00:41:40.160,00:41:44.180

as many people working on it,",00:41:44.180,00:41:47.730

about this.,00:41:51.260,00:41:51.810

We should work on that.,00:46:24.800,00:46:27.030
"Professor Sataway,
a lot of people",00:46:27.030,00:46:28.960

battery technology that",00:46:28.960,00:46:32.350

"So you don't want to just bet
on those because the costs are",00:46:41.640,00:46:45.640
"hard, because it's farming,

well up to about 20%",00:46:53.920,00:46:56.800

ways, is the coolest of all",00:47:05.680,00:47:09.430
"because you put the
plant near the demand,",00:47:09.430,00:47:13.612

there's sun or not.",00:47:13.612,00:47:15.320

has the advantage",00:47:29.440,00:47:33.070

huge advantage,",00:47:40.480,00:47:42.640

more than wipe out",00:47:46.900,00:47:48.850
"your million for one advantage,
and today's nuclear plants",00:47:48.850,00:47:52.750
are fairly expensive.,00:47:52.750,00:47:54.220
"At least the way they're
built outside of China",00:47:54.220,00:47:57.060
they're quite expensive.,00:47:57.060,00:47:58.060
"China is actually building
them in three years",00:47:58.060,00:47:59.977

designs and things like that.,00:48:05.770,00:48:07.060

one of the directions",00:48:07.060,00:48:10.735
that we should innovate in.,00:48:10.735,00:48:11.860
"Nuclear innovation
stopped in the 1970s,",00:48:11.860,00:48:14.140
"we basically have
this sub design thing",00:48:14.140,00:48:17.320
"that was put into shipping port
for the first power generator,",00:48:17.320,00:48:21.740
"and we basically
built 400 of those",00:48:21.740,00:48:24.010
"that are all custom, but
not many interesting way.",00:48:24.010,00:48:28.900
They're all LWRs and PWRs.,00:48:28.900,00:48:32.170

innovate much at all.",00:48:32.170,00:48:34.820
"There's this third generation
passive safety P 1000,",00:48:34.820,00:48:37.390
"but except for that,
it didn't do much.",00:48:37.390,00:48:39.170
"The question is, can we
get 1,000 bright minds",00:48:39.170,00:48:42.430
"with 20 different ideas and
we're starting to see that.",00:48:42.430,00:48:47.350

molten salt reactors,",00:48:52.660,00:48:55.510

we use U238, depleted uranium.",00:48:57.500,00:49:02.980

have fast neutrons,",00:49:02.980,00:49:04.570
"we have this neutron budget
that's very different.",00:49:04.570,00:49:08.140
"Now, our main problem is a
material science problem.",00:49:08.140,00:49:10.420
"Is these damn neutrons
degrading, the cladding",00:49:10.420,00:49:14.710
"and everything, and we
don't have a predictable way",00:49:14.710,00:49:18.040
"of saying, over a 40-year
lifetime, how various materials",00:49:18.040,00:49:23.170
deal with that.,00:49:23.170,00:49:23.855
"If you look at the
fusion guys, they're",00:49:23.855,00:49:25.480
"neutrons are 1,000 times
worse than our neutrons,",00:49:25.480,00:49:27.940

"those guys have 14 NPV
neutrons, good luck to them.",00:49:30.280,00:49:34.060
"But some people
should work on that.",00:49:34.060,00:49:36.730
"That is not an easy thing,
in terms of the economics.",00:49:36.730,00:49:40.270
"So nuclear, in terms of
[INAUDIBLE] is incredible,",00:49:40.270,00:49:43.260

we're talking about,",00:49:43.260,00:49:45.540
"it is infinite, that is you
can filter out of the sea",00:49:45.540,00:49:49.350

as the sun will shine.,00:49:52.140,00:49:53.400

"You don't worry about
the amount of uranium.",00:49:57.915,00:50:00.890
"So anyway, I think it's
one of the approaches that",00:50:00.890,00:50:04.740
a ton more should be done in.,00:50:04.740,00:50:07.500

batteries, we need more money",00:50:09.305,00:50:11.430
"in transmission, this is
an underinvestment area",00:50:11.430,00:50:15.930

actually does",00:50:15.930,00:50:18.330

have been proposed,",00:50:21.350,00:50:23.100
"don't actually fund R&amp;D
at a reasonable level,",00:50:23.100,00:50:26.080
"so it's a tragic
thing that, hopefully,",00:50:26.080,00:50:29.370
"if we get a revenue source, that
we can take the energy, R&amp;D,",00:50:29.370,00:50:33.840

of three or four more.",00:50:33.840,00:50:36.400

"is when those people would
have would have been trained.",00:51:59.030,00:52:04.560
Go ahead.,00:52:04.560,00:52:05.298
AUDIENCE: Hi.,00:52:05.298,00:52:05.840
My name is [INAUDIBLE].,00:52:05.840,00:52:06.620
"I'm a freshman, and I'm
researching with Professor",00:52:06.620,00:52:08.870
"Sataway, actually.",00:52:08.870,00:52:10.520
"And thank you for coming
to MIT, though you probably",00:52:10.520,00:52:13.580
like Harvard better.,00:52:13.580,00:52:15.101
"GATES: No, no, no.",00:52:15.101,00:52:15.851
[LAUGHTER],00:52:15.851,00:52:16.550
AUDIENCE: Just kidding.,00:52:16.550,00:52:18.200
So my question is two part.,00:52:18.200,00:52:20.420
"The first part is
that earlier you",00:52:20.420,00:52:22.310
"were talking about how you
think that it'll be a challenge",00:52:22.310,00:52:25.250
"to get a lot of young people
into researching for helping",00:52:25.250,00:52:30.200
"poverty and helping the world
issues because they might not",00:52:30.200,00:52:33.650
"find a financial
incentive in this,",00:52:33.650,00:52:35.623
"and you said that this would
be an interesting drama",00:52:35.623,00:52:37.790
to look at.,00:52:37.790,00:52:38.870
"But I was wondering,
first of all,",00:52:38.870,00:52:40.380
"if you could elaborate a little
bit on how you would look",00:52:40.380,00:52:45.740
"at this problem and
what sorts of approaches",00:52:45.740,00:52:47.840
"you would take, and do you want
me to say the second part now",00:52:47.840,00:52:50.550
or after your answer?,00:52:50.550,00:52:52.255
"GATES: Oh, I'll
answer this, then",00:52:52.255,00:52:53.630
you can do the second part.,00:52:53.630,00:52:56.980
"Part of the solution is to
take corporations, like drug",00:52:56.980,00:53:00.430
"companies, phone
companies, banks,",00:53:00.430,00:53:03.100
"and get them to put
some of their innovators",00:53:03.100,00:53:06.520
"on these problems that are
less renumeration of perhaps,",00:53:06.520,00:53:10.210
"but overall, in terms of
their reputation and hiring",00:53:10.210,00:53:14.170
"and things like that,
and that's happening.",00:53:14.170,00:53:16.540
"We funded a group called
access to medicines",00:53:16.540,00:53:19.390
"that ranks the
pharmaceutical companies,",00:53:19.390,00:53:22.040
"according to how much they
work on diseases of the poor,",00:53:22.040,00:53:27.010
"and it came out like we thought
it would with GSK on top",00:53:27.010,00:53:31.450
"and various other
people in the bottom.",00:53:31.450,00:53:34.690
"And the right thing
happened, which",00:53:34.690,00:53:36.370
"is the people on the bottom
called this up and said,",00:53:36.370,00:53:39.100
this is embarrassing.,00:53:39.100,00:53:41.400
"Well, are there projects and
things we should be doing?",00:53:41.400,00:53:45.370
"So spreading that to other
end industries, banking,",00:53:45.370,00:53:47.920
"cell phones, the food
companies, been great.",00:53:47.920,00:53:49.990
"We haven't done the index yet,
but the Nestle's, Unilever's,",00:53:49.990,00:53:54.070
"Coke's, their
willingness to work",00:53:54.070,00:53:55.630
"with us on agricultural
sourcing, nutrition products.",00:53:55.630,00:53:59.780
"They've been
amazingly effective.",00:53:59.780,00:54:01.870
"So bringing the
companies in so that you",00:54:01.870,00:54:04.360
"have people working at the
companies who can do the stats",00:54:04.360,00:54:07.000
is important.,00:54:07.000,00:54:08.860
"Government funding for
these things, which",00:54:08.860,00:54:11.410
is mostly the delivery piece.,00:54:11.410,00:54:12.790
"That's the foreign
aid budget, making",00:54:12.790,00:54:15.190
"the case for that, that
that should stay strong,",00:54:15.190,00:54:17.717
it's very important.,00:54:17.717,00:54:18.550
"Getting people
like the NIH, who--",00:54:18.550,00:54:20.500
"or others, but NIH is big--",00:54:20.500,00:54:23.710
"to tilt a little bit towards
the disease of the poor",00:54:23.710,00:54:27.388
in terms of work they do.,00:54:27.388,00:54:28.430
"And Francis Collins,
the current director,",00:54:28.430,00:54:30.660
"is thinking about some creative
things there that'll happen.",00:54:30.660,00:54:35.050
"Ironically, drug
approval is still",00:54:35.050,00:54:37.128
"this weird thing where
poor countries don't",00:54:37.128,00:54:38.920
"trust themselves
to approve drugs,",00:54:38.920,00:54:40.930
"and so when we want
to do a new TV drug,",00:54:40.930,00:54:43.310
it has to be approved--,00:54:43.310,00:54:46.420
"no country will accept it
unless either FDA, the US",00:54:46.420,00:54:49.620
"regulator, or EMA, the
European regulator accepts it.",00:54:49.620,00:54:53.380
"And they don't have
the right process",00:54:53.380,00:54:55.810
for triple drug therapy.,00:54:55.810,00:54:57.280
"They'd make us,
under normal things,",00:54:57.280,00:54:58.990
"go through three
phase 3s, which that's",00:54:58.990,00:55:01.330
15 years and over $1 billion.,00:55:01.330,00:55:03.820
"So they're working with
us on these things.",00:55:03.820,00:55:06.490
"We're trying to
get vouchers, where",00:55:06.490,00:55:09.490
"if you do drugs for the
poor, you get faster FDA",00:55:09.490,00:55:12.760
"review on your rich world
drugs, so we need government,",00:55:12.760,00:55:18.710
"philanthropy, and corporate
money to go into this,",00:55:18.710,00:55:21.950
and that's the economic piece.,00:55:21.950,00:55:23.732
"Then, we need the
visibility, where",00:55:23.732,00:55:25.190
"people feel like this
is a great thing,",00:55:25.190,00:55:26.815
"and there is
progress, whether it's",00:55:26.815,00:55:29.690
"prizes or awards or
things like that,",00:55:29.690,00:55:31.860
"there's a lot more
that can be done.",00:55:31.860,00:55:34.200
So what's the second one?,00:55:34.200,00:55:36.957
"AUDIENCE: The second
is less academic.",00:55:36.957,00:55:38.540
"I'm just curious, how does being
the richest person in the world",00:55:38.540,00:55:41.480
affect your life?,00:55:41.480,00:55:42.690
I mean--,00:55:42.690,00:55:43.190
[LAUGHTER],00:55:43.190,00:55:45.170
"GATES: Well, the marginal
return for extra dollars",00:55:47.650,00:55:53.180
does drop off.,00:55:53.180,00:55:58.100
"I haven't found any burgers at
any price that are better than",00:55:58.100,00:56:01.440
McDonald's.,00:56:01.440,00:56:02.630
[LAUGHTER],00:56:02.630,00:56:03.130
[APPLAUSE],00:56:03.130,00:56:05.070
"There's a few things like
air travel, where it's nice--",00:56:08.960,00:56:16.440
[LAUGHTER],00:56:16.440,00:56:17.910
"But other than that,
overwhelmingly,",00:56:19.870,00:56:22.030
"once you get past,
some point, I don't",00:56:22.030,00:56:24.860
"know what it is, a few
million or something,",00:56:24.860,00:56:27.530
"then it's all about how
you're going to give it back.",00:56:27.530,00:56:33.413
"Are you going to
pick someone, are",00:56:33.413,00:56:34.830
"you going to get
involved yourself,",00:56:34.830,00:56:36.370
how are you going to do that?,00:56:36.370,00:56:38.020
"And for some people,
strangely, that's",00:56:38.020,00:56:41.140
"actually a burden,
where they're worried",00:56:41.140,00:56:43.270
"they won't to do it well,
or all that, and so partly,",00:56:43.270,00:56:47.710
"making that easier, making
that more widespread",00:56:47.710,00:56:49.840
"is one of the things I think is
interesting that can help more.",00:56:49.840,00:56:53.350
"If we could double philanthropy,
if we could get India and China",00:56:53.350,00:56:56.380
"billionaires, for example, to
be as generous as the US is",00:56:56.380,00:56:59.270
"or get us to be
twice as generous",00:56:59.270,00:57:01.390
"and then get them
to match up to that,",00:57:01.390,00:57:04.330
"it'd be a substantial
amount of money.",00:57:04.330,00:57:07.880
"I guess I've used up all
my time, so thank you.",00:57:07.880,00:57:11.650
Those were great questions.,00:57:11.650,00:57:14.020
"Let me just leave you with a
small challenge or opportunity,",00:57:14.020,00:57:18.590
"which is that on the
Foundation Facebook website,",00:57:18.590,00:57:22.930
"if you have ideas about
a particular problem",00:57:22.930,00:57:25.360
"or the general issue
of drawing people in,",00:57:25.360,00:57:27.280
"if you have ideas
about that, I encourage",00:57:27.280,00:57:29.380
"you to post there because
I'll go look at that",00:57:29.380,00:57:32.020
"and see if there's things
that we ought to help promote.",00:57:32.020,00:57:34.990
"And hopefully, we'll
get a lot of good ideas.",00:57:34.990,00:57:36.955
"Obviously, coming
here, you are people",00:57:39.850,00:57:41.620
"who believe in these things, so
I want to thank you for that,",00:57:41.620,00:57:44.380
"but think hard about how we can
get even more people involved.",00:57:44.380,00:57:49.781
[APPLAUSE],00:57:49.781,00:57:52.236
"SCHANER: So thank
you, Mr. Gates,",00:58:11.835,00:58:13.210
"for taking the time to
answer our questions.",00:58:13.210,00:58:15.730
"Please accept on behalf
of my fellow students,",00:58:15.730,00:58:18.130
"our appreciation for your
interest in our work,",00:58:18.130,00:58:20.470
"and I speak for everyone
here in thanking you",00:58:20.470,00:58:22.615
"for the support and friendship
you've shown to MIT.",00:58:22.615,00:58:24.740
[APPLAUSE],00:58:24.740,00:58:28.090
