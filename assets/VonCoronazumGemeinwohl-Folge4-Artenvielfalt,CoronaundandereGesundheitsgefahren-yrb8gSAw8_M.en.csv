"In the last video, I introduced a number of new terms, including ""phobocracy"":",00:00:00.190,00:00:06.460
domination by fear.,00:00:06.460,00:00:07.880
This term will surely keep us busy for a while.,00:00:07.880,00:00:11.759
"I would also like to start this video with a new term, namely zoonosis.",00:00:11.759,00:00:18.360
This means infectious diseases that occur simultaneously in humans and vertebrates,00:00:18.360,00:00:23.290
- and can spread in one direction or the other.,00:00:23.290,00:00:28.010
Around 200 zoonoses are currently known worldwide.,00:00:28.010,00:00:32.649
"When an illness spreads from humans to animals, one speaks of anthopozoonosis",00:00:32.649,00:00:38.949
and in the opposite direction of zooanthroponosis - this also includes the coronavirus.,00:00:38.949,00:00:44.800
"The phenomenon itself is not new, for example tuberculosis and measles originally came",00:00:44.800,00:00:51.829
"from cows, whooping cough from pigs or the flu from ducks.",00:00:51.829,00:00:57.430
"Only about a third of all skipping diseases come from pets, and a good two thirds",00:00:57.430,00:01:03.999
from wild animals.,00:01:03.999,00:01:04.999
A first wave of skipping diseases took place in the course of colonization.,00:01:04.999,00:01:09.720
"For example, the bacterium that triggers cholera comes from the swamps of Bangladesh.",00:01:09.720,00:01:15.490
"A second wave, after some doctors believed in the end of infectious diseases,",00:01:15.490,00:01:21.640
has recently started and has brought us very dangerous diseases,00:01:21.640,00:01:27.090
"such as HIV / AIDS, Ebola, Mers and Sars1 or even Sars2 (or Covid-19).",00:01:27.090,00:01:36.600
The common cause of these zooanthroponoses is the increasing environmental pressure of human,00:01:37.860,00:01:44.740
"civilization on the habitats of these wild animals, e.g.",00:01:44.740,00:01:48.860
"by hunting, deforestation or intensive livestock farming.",00:01:48.860,00:01:53.440
"In other words, the increasing consumption of space, materials and energy by mankind.",00:01:53.440,00:01:58.710
"The connection is scientifically proven: the greater the environmental pressure of humans,",00:01:58.710,00:02:04.590
"the greater the stress in wild animals, the higher the likelihood of further zoonoses.",00:02:04.590,00:02:09.800
"According to the current state of science, the corona virus originally comes from",00:02:10.800,00:02:16.220
wild bats and came to humans via the intermediate host of the pangolin.,00:02:16.220,00:02:21.300
It is interesting to know that countless microbes live in bats,00:02:21.300,00:02:27.030
without being harmed by them.,00:02:27.030,00:02:28.390
"But when the stress on bats increases, so does their infectivity.",00:02:28.390,00:02:34.060
And humans should never come into contact with pangolins anyways,00:02:34.060,00:02:39.060
because they are strictly protected.,00:02:39.060,00:02:41.150
"According to experts, many thousands of other viruses live in wild animals that can potentially skip.",00:02:41.150,00:02:48.230
The less mankind is concerned with ecological balance; and the less we,00:02:49.230,00:02:54.510
"humans respect the limits of wildlife habitats, the harder limits nature will set us",00:02:54.510,00:02:59.520
in the form of further pandemics.,00:02:59.520,00:03:03.470
"Some are already talking about Covid 20, 21, etc.",00:03:03.470,00:03:07.860
So if we really care about health - public health - the first step would be,00:03:07.860,00:03:14.599
to drastically reduce mankind's ecological footprint,00:03:14.599,00:03:20.550
and to protect wildlife habitats and biodiversity and the biosphere,00:03:20.550,00:03:26.270
in general much more strictly.,00:03:26.270,00:03:27.270
We actually knew this before Corona: In the past few years I have started almost every one of my,00:03:27.270,00:03:33.180
public lectures with the fact that climate change is not only not the greatest,00:03:33.180,00:03:38.709
"global ecological threat to humanity, but also not the most dangerous.",00:03:38.709,00:03:43.810
"Although dangerous, it can cost the lives of hundreds of millions of people,",00:03:43.810,00:03:48.710
"and even more health, and is therefore more dangerous than a single",00:03:48.710,00:03:53.340
corona virus.,00:03:53.340,00:03:54.340
But the greatest ecological threat to humanity is the loss of biodiversity.,00:03:54.340,00:04:00.569
"On the one hand, because humans are at the end of many food chains and tearing them off",00:04:00.569,00:04:07.050
in the middle of a chain can lead to the breaking off of part of the human,00:04:07.050,00:04:12.620
nutritional basis.,00:04:12.620,00:04:13.770
"On the other hand, many species within complex ecosystems perform sensitive key functions",00:04:13.770,00:04:21.350
for the stability and functionality of these ecosystems - and their extinction can,00:04:21.350,00:04:26.320
lead to the overturning of these ecosystems and thus prove to be even more dangerous for mankind,00:04:26.320,00:04:32.180
than climate change.,00:04:32.180,00:04:34.560
"According to a long-term study in Germany, the biomass of insects in 63 protected regions",00:04:34.560,00:04:41.730
has decreased by over three quarters in the past 20 years.,00:04:41.730,00:04:44.990
Nobody can predict where that will lead.,00:04:44.990,00:04:48.600
"Therefore, the popular protection request in Bavaria, which came from the population,",00:04:48.600,00:04:54.690
was just right.,00:04:54.690,00:04:56.150
"On the other hand, economists' forecast models, which do not even include",00:04:56.150,00:05:01.090
"biodiversity, endanger the future of humanity.",00:05:01.090,00:05:04.431
The protection of biodiversity must become the highest political priority!,00:05:04.431,00:05:08.920
"The so-called planetary boundaries to the bottom-line of economic policy, world domestic policy",00:05:08.920,00:05:15.680
and the survival strategy of humans - and thus also to the limits of economic,00:05:15.680,00:05:21.770
and consumer freedom.,00:05:21.770,00:05:22.970
"In order to achieve this goal, I have developed a personal implementation proposal,",00:05:22.970,00:05:29.080
"which I call ""ecological human rights"".",00:05:29.080,00:05:32.710
The starting point is the enormous gift that planet earth makes available to human beings,00:05:32.710,00:05:38.790
year after year without the stability of the ecosystems declining.,00:05:38.790,00:05:45.210
This huge gift is more than what eight billion people need to meet,00:05:46.210,00:05:51.040
"their basic needs, but it is less than what humanity",00:05:51.040,00:05:55.710
"as a whole is consuming today because a small minority of mankind is in extreme overuse,",00:05:55.710,00:06:02.510
including the average person in Germany and Austria.,00:06:02.510,00:06:09.009
If every human being received an eight billionth of what the earth made available to,00:06:09.009,00:06:13.910
"humanity as a whole, that could be seen as an ecological consumption right on",00:06:13.910,00:06:19.430
the front of the medal and on the back of the medal it would be a protective right,00:06:19.430,00:06:24.889
of the planet because if all ecological human rights were consumed humanity,00:06:24.889,00:06:31.130
would remain within the ecological limits of the planet.,00:06:31.130,00:06:35.180
"And thus provide our children and grandchildren with the same right to live,",00:06:35.180,00:06:41.759
the same opportunities and freedoms as we do.,00:06:41.759,00:06:44.410
The technical implementation could be done by giving everyone a so-called ecological,00:06:44.410,00:06:50.460
"or environmental account, on which this annual consumption right is booked.",00:06:50.460,00:06:55.180
"Of course not in monetary units, but in physical quantities.",00:06:55.180,00:06:58.870
"The most common form at present is the so-called ecological footprint, which",00:06:58.870,00:07:04.820
"is measured in so-called ""global hectares"" and amounts to 1.7 global hectares per person in a globally sustainable",00:07:04.820,00:07:11.210
and fair distribution.,00:07:11.210,00:07:16.259
"If the eco account is empty, the same would happen as it does today if the financial",00:07:16.259,00:07:21.850
account is empty.,00:07:21.850,00:07:22.850
The purchasing power would have gone out.,00:07:22.850,00:07:23.979
"A possible ""add on"" would be that, in addition to the amount that people need to meet their basic needs,",00:07:23.979,00:07:31.630
"this consumption right, there is still a small surplus according to current",00:07:31.630,00:07:38.320
"estimates by science, will be tradable so that the poorest,",00:07:38.320,00:07:42.960
those who lack the financial purchasing power to consume their ecological consumption rights,00:07:42.960,00:07:48.240
"could sell this surplus to the wealthiest, who have sufficient financial purchasing power",00:07:48.240,00:07:54.520
but not the sufficient ecological purchasing power to satisfy,00:07:54.520,00:07:59.740
all of their consumption expectations.,00:07:59.740,00:08:01.740
This would allow the richest to land a little more gently and the poorer to have a higher,00:08:01.740,00:08:07.300
financial income - that would be a global social-ecological win-win situation.,00:08:07.300,00:08:13.910
"Even in this stage of expansion, humanity as a whole would remain within the planetary limits.",00:08:13.910,00:08:20.860
And these 1.7 global hectares could become a vital indicator,00:08:21.860,00:08:29.190
for government action!,00:08:29.190,00:08:32.640
In previous corona crisis management there was a key figure that put everything,00:08:32.640,00:08:38.390
else in the shade: the replication factor 1.,00:08:38.390,00:08:42.210
No one should infect more than one other person.,00:08:42.210,00:08:46.029
Everything else - from compulsory schooling to fundamental rights - was subordinated,00:08:46.029,00:08:51.900
to this top government guideline.,00:08:51.900,00:08:54.060
Even GDP growth suddenly became a relative minor issue.,00:08:54.060,00:08:59.899
The aim of protecting public health is behind the indicator.,00:08:59.899,00:09:04.430
But is replication factor 1 really the most effective measure to achieve this goal?,00:09:04.430,00:09:10.850
"If the government's goal is to protect public health, then it should",00:09:11.850,00:09:17.390
- in a fact-based manner - summarize all the threats to public health,00:09:17.390,00:09:21.870
"in order to take more consistent measures, the greater",00:09:21.870,00:09:27.279
the individual risk.,00:09:27.279,00:09:28.420
"We currently have slightly more than 250,000 Corona deaths worldwide.",00:09:28.420,00:09:34.589
"Hunger kills 9 million people every year, including 3 million children under the age of 5.",00:09:34.589,00:09:42.209
How much are governments doing to save these people from starvation?,00:09:42.209,00:09:47.800
Perhaps some people are now thinking that this is not the best example of the European Union,00:09:47.800,00:09:52.330
because few or no people are starving here.,00:09:52.330,00:09:55.800
But it is certainly a very good example for the whole world.,00:09:55.800,00:09:59.490
Because currently 370 million children who are not allowed to go to school are cut off,00:09:59.490,00:10:06.800
from school lunches.,00:10:06.800,00:10:07.800
And just imagine one child who doesn't get the expected and legitimate food.,00:10:07.800,00:10:13.720
370 million of them!,00:10:15.350,00:10:16.870
The United Nations World Food Program currently provides 100 million,00:10:16.870,00:10:22.980
of the 870 million malnourished people with daily emergency meals.,00:10:22.980,00:10:27.920
"If these care measures are prevented with corona measures, the director of the program says",00:10:27.920,00:10:36.320
"- more people could starve to death every day in the next 3 months - namely 300,000",00:10:36.320,00:10:42.230
- than have died so far on Covid-19 worldwide.,00:10:42.230,00:10:48.360
"The World Labor Organization (ILO), in turn, points out that the corona measures currently",00:10:48.360,00:10:54.170
"pose a threat to 435 million companies and, now, 1.7 billion people who work",00:10:54.170,00:11:04.550
"in the so-called informal sector, that is living from “hand to mouth”.",00:11:04.550,00:11:10.300
They lost an average of 60% of their income in the first month of the crisis.,00:11:10.300,00:11:14.839
"""Without alternative sources of income,"" writes the ILO, these people have",00:11:14.839,00:11:22.370
no survival resources.,00:11:22.370,00:11:23.370
"With each lockdown that is getting longer every day, we are producing a humanitarian disaster",00:11:23.370,00:11:30.339
without comparison.,00:11:30.339,00:11:31.920
"Fortunately, there is comparatively little hunger in the European Union",00:11:31.920,00:11:37.890
and only a small informal sector.,00:11:37.890,00:11:40.020
So I'm going to choose an example that applies to the EU:,00:11:40.020,00:11:45.050
"Air pollution costs 4.2 million lives a year, according to the WHO. According to the European Environment Agency,",00:11:45.050,00:11:51.899
"there are 450,000 people who die prematurely in the EU each year",00:11:51.899,00:12:01.360
"due to fine dust, nitrogen oxides and ground-level ozone.",00:12:01.360,00:12:05.540
"By comparison, I wonder why the governments that justify the corona measures with their responsibility",00:12:05.540,00:12:11.670
for our health do so much less here!,00:12:11.670,00:12:17.390
"Given these facts, it is completely disproportionate how much is done against Corona and how little",00:12:17.390,00:12:24.630
is done against air pollution.,00:12:24.630,00:12:27.350
"In other words, we are disproportionately afraid of corona - phobocracy",00:12:27.350,00:12:34.319
- and proportionately less afraid of air pollution.,00:12:34.319,00:12:39.440
Here the governments play down in comparison.,00:12:39.440,00:12:42.670
"Why don't we get the latest figures on air pollution, like number of hospitalized",00:12:42.670,00:12:48.350
"and intensified people, as well as premature deaths every day - until this",00:12:48.350,00:12:54.550
"public figure reaches 450,000 deaths in the EU at the end of the year?",00:12:54.550,00:13:00.110
The last example: The number of people killed in traffic accidents is,00:13:00.110,00:13:07.860
1.35 million annually worldwide.,00:13:07.860,00:13:09.620
Traffic accidents are the number one cause of death worldwide for 5 to 29 year olds!,00:13:09.620,00:13:17.339
"In addition, there are 50 million injuries, often with permanent health problems",00:13:17.339,00:13:25.290
"such as crutches, prostheses or wheelchairs.",00:13:25.290,00:13:28.540
"In the EU, there are ""only"" 25,000 deaths from road accidents every year",00:13:28.540,00:13:36.240
"- but there are also 135,000 seriously injured, which is a total of 160,000 deplorable victims.",00:13:36.240,00:13:44.090
"Preventing this would not require a shutdown, as with Corona, but a consequent",00:13:44.090,00:13:51.230
expansion of public transport and the consolidation of settlement structures.,00:13:51.230,00:13:55.700
"In a public text in 1996, out of concern for health and the environment,",00:13:55.700,00:14:03.899
"I described motorized private transport as a ""silent war"" due to the millions of people injured",00:14:03.899,00:14:09.660
and killed in recent years and asked why little or too little,00:14:09.660,00:14:16.540
is being done about it.,00:14:16.540,00:14:19.579
"Angela Merkel literally describes Corona as ""the greatest challenge since",00:14:19.579,00:14:28.970
"World War II"" - and at the same time continues to subsidize the car industry.",00:14:29.970,00:14:34.440
The Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz said literally that in Austria,00:14:34.440,00:14:40.240
"""soon everyone would know someone who died of Corona.""",00:14:40.240,00:14:44.590
"Given the current number of cases, this would only work out if everyone",00:14:44.590,00:14:49.450
"in Austria actually knew everyone, as we like to say.",00:14:49.450,00:14:52.940
"On the other hand, everyone in Austria probably knows a person",00:14:52.940,00:14:58.029
who was injured or even killed in a traffic accident.,00:14:58.029,00:15:02.450
It would therefore be proportionate here for us to find out daily in the evening news,00:15:02.450,00:15:08.480
"how many people have been injured in road accidents this year,",00:15:08.480,00:15:14.850
"have been hospitalized, received a prosthesis, had to go to the wheelchair or were even killed.",00:15:14.850,00:15:20.730
And then it would be up to the government to act and prevent these unnecessary casualties,00:15:21.730,00:15:27.800
if it is concerned about public health as it is at Corona.,00:15:27.800,00:15:34.060
What I want to ask with these examples is whether the subordination of everything else,00:15:34.060,00:15:38.980
"to replication factor 1 is really ""evidence-based policy"".",00:15:38.980,00:15:44.790
"I think it would be more important, more human and more ethical, to do everything to",00:15:44.790,00:15:51.989
"- to reduce world hunger by 10% annually
- reduce death by air pollution by 10%",00:15:51.989,00:15:59.320
annually - and to reduce the number of people injured and killed in traffic,00:15:59.320,00:16:04.350
"by 10% annually
and at the same time:",00:16:04.350,00:16:09.269
- proclaim the 1.5 degree target as the maximum warming of the earth's atmosphere to the top political,00:16:09.269,00:16:16.430
"key figure, no matter what percentage of economic growth it would cost;",00:16:16.430,00:16:22.070
"- together with a maximum of 1.7 global hectares of ecological footprint per person, in the form",00:16:22.070,00:16:29.440
of the proclamation and allocation of ecological human rights;,00:16:29.440,00:16:33.279
"- thirdly, I would limit income inequality to a factor of 10, 20 or",00:16:33.279,00:16:39.790
"maybe 30 - and set an upper limit for private wealth at 10, 20 or 30",00:16:39.790,00:16:47.300
million euros.,00:16:47.300,00:16:49.000
These three measures could make an extremely important contribution to protecting the health,00:16:49.000,00:16:54.760
"and life of millions, maybe even billions, of people!",00:16:54.760,00:16:59.420
The same applies to people living today as to our children and grandchildren.,00:16:59.420,00:17:04.029
An asset cap would also affect Bill Gates.,00:17:04.029,00:17:09.169
"Instead of 90 billion, it could only have 30 million, for example.",00:17:09.169,00:17:16.179
"According to scientific studies, this would not affect his personal",00:17:16.179,00:17:19.990
happiness in life.,00:17:19.990,00:17:21.639
"On the other hand, it would probably be a greater happiness for all of humanity.",00:17:21.639,00:17:26.559
There are currently wild conspiracy fantasies surrounding the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation (BMGF).,00:17:26.559,00:17:31.989
I cannot and will not judge whether there is anything in them - the presumption of innocence applies.,00:17:32.989,00:17:38.259
"However, what should not be the case is that the BMGF is the second largest funding body",00:17:38.259,00:17:45.979
of the WHO.,00:17:45.979,00:17:49.109
"According to its own statements, the U.S. paid $ 280 million in 2018, the Bill and Melinda Gates",00:17:49.109,00:17:58.070
"Foundation (BMGF) $ 230 million,",00:17:58.070,00:18:00.240
Germany $ 150 million and the EU Commission $ 75 million.,00:18:00.240,00:18:06.289
"If, as announced, the United States now withdraws from WHO funding,",00:18:07.289,00:18:12.820
the BMGF would be the largest donor to this organization - and that would be no less a scandal,00:18:12.820,00:18:20.499
than the privatization of global health policy.,00:18:20.499,00:18:23.320
This example shows how democracies abolish themselves by tolerating,00:18:23.320,00:18:30.830
boundless inequality.,00:18:30.830,00:18:31.899
"First of all, mostly millionaires make it to the political offices, there they mostly make",00:18:31.899,00:18:37.960
"politics for millionaires, for example, they withdraw the states from the financing",00:18:37.960,00:18:43.320
"of public goods such as health, and then the private billionaires",00:18:43.320,00:18:48.809
step in patronizingly!,00:18:48.809,00:18:49.809
This is not altruism because there is participation in the money - Bill Gates sets,00:18:49.809,00:18:56.720
the priorities.,00:18:56.720,00:18:57.740
What bothers me in this context is that Bill Gates was allowed to dream for a quarter,00:18:57.740,00:19:03.009
of an hour in the German Tagesschau to vaccinate all,00:19:03.009,00:19:08.620
living people around the world against Covid-19.,00:19:08.620,00:19:11.249
"He said literally: ""This is a vaccination that we will give 7 billion people""",00:19:11.249,00:19:16.850
in an indicative manner and with a grin on his face - what exactly gives him,00:19:16.850,00:19:22.729
pleasure at this idea was not clear from the content.,00:19:22.729,00:19:26.350
"A vaccination fan whose foundation had invested nearly $ 3 billion in Exxon, Coca-Cola",00:19:26.350,00:19:33.929
"and McDonald’s stocks by 2014, becoming rich in climate change, tooth decay, and",00:19:33.929,00:19:40.129
diabetes - how credible is that?,00:19:40.129,00:19:41.970
What basically bothers me here is that individual people can become so,00:19:41.970,00:19:47.720
rich and powerful.,00:19:47.720,00:19:48.869
Our democracies still have a lot to learn to limit the power of individuals.,00:19:48.869,00:19:53.890
"Incidentally, this is called separation of powers - a very liberal principle.",00:19:53.890,00:19:58.799
"What billions are spent on should be decided democratically, I have",00:19:58.799,00:20:03.509
"a few ideas:
- end world hunger;",00:20:03.509,00:20:06.199
"- stop air pollution;
- protect biodiversity;",00:20:06.199,00:20:09.900
- stop climate change.,00:20:09.900,00:20:13.049
"In the first video, I argued that governments are happy to hide behind people",00:20:13.049,00:20:18.460
when it comes to protecting the earth and health: They are,00:20:18.460,00:20:23.480
"not ready to give anything up, so there is nothing you can do.",00:20:23.480,00:20:26.899
"With the measures against Corona up to the lockdown, they have impressively demonstrated",00:20:26.899,00:20:32.359
that they have no problem whatsoever in forcing us to renounce all,00:20:32.359,00:20:36.919
the way to fundamental rights!,00:20:36.919,00:20:37.919
But that makes its argument untrustworthy.,00:20:37.919,00:20:40.849
"And it is also not convincing in terms of content: Because if we protect the planet, we have",00:20:40.849,00:20:47.341
to do without much less in the overall picture than if we ruin it.,00:20:47.341,00:20:51.720
And we lose much more of our freedoms we love when we heat the climate and,00:20:51.720,00:20:58.299
decimate biodiversity instead of maintaining the ecological balance of the biosphere.,00:20:58.299,00:21:03.710
"Specifically, this means that we have to do without NOW in global consumer and growth capitalism:",00:21:04.710,00:21:11.629
"drinkable rivers, edible fish, clean air and healthy airways, deep",00:21:11.629,00:21:19.450
"restful sleep, green cities, successful relationships, social trust,",00:21:19.450,00:21:25.379
functioning democracy and - free of life of serial zoonoses.,00:21:25.379,00:21:30.840
We would gain all of this in reverse if we instead strive,00:21:30.840,00:21:37.369
for ecological balance as our top priority!,00:21:37.369,00:21:40.649
Perhaps you will make your personal list of what you now have to do without,00:21:40.649,00:21:45.890
"- in global growth, financial and consumer capitalism.",00:21:45.890,00:21:50.139
And what you would gain in an ecological balance economy.,00:21:50.139,00:21:54.860
"If we do business and live in such a way that we do not destroy the planet,",00:21:54.860,00:22:00.919
"we will be in connection with the earth that nourishes us, gives us energy",00:22:00.919,00:22:06.710
and makes us happy.,00:22:06.710,00:22:07.710
Reconnecting to the earth - deep ecology - would be a radical,00:22:07.710,00:22:14.279
"health measure, equally for individual and public health,",00:22:14.279,00:22:19.229
which would also cost nothing.,00:22:19.229,00:22:20.229
I hope that the number of people who gain this insight or - even better - experience,00:22:20.229,00:22:25.059
increases with a replication factor&gt; 1.,00:22:25.059,00:22:29.489
Also in circles of governors and billionaires.,00:22:29.489,00:22:32.789
