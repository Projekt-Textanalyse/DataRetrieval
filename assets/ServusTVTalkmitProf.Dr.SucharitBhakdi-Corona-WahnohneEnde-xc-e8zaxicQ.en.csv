who inform themselves on the internet because",00:00:54.359,00:00:58.739
"you have the impression that criticism

"media in public law
TV stations largely left out",00:01:03.749,00:01:07.260

"and economic life of your countries
shut down completely",00:01:22.740,00:01:26.840
"leading international experts like the
often for his research as",00:01:26.840,00:01:31.740
"epidemiologist excellent professor
Bhakdi, however, point this out",00:01:31.740,00:01:36.390
"indicating that the measures for containment
are completely covered",00:01:36.390,00:01:40.560
"but many classic and in particular
the public law media",00:01:40.560,00:01:45.170
"ignore the expertise of dozens
renowned experts",00:01:45.170,00:01:49.310
"instead you try scientists
as professor doctor as active as",00:01:49.310,00:01:54.390
"to present questionable
but what are the critics' arguments?",00:01:54.390,00:01:58.900
"and why do you see the latest studies
the american elite university",00:01:58.900,00:02:03.150
standford as proof of this,00:02:03.150,00:02:07.440

renowned doctor researchers you have",00:02:08.880,00:02:14.620
"trained doctors for decades
and actually have been for some years",00:02:14.620,00:02:19.480

now that you have criticized",00:02:19.480,00:02:22.959
"Measures are on the internet at the corona
attacked by many media and",00:02:22.959,00:02:28.840
"has been presented as questionable
regret is that you vote",00:02:28.840,00:02:32.980
"did not raise because I of course
didn't raise my voice and",00:02:32.980,00:02:38.560
"against which people to challenge
but because it is my duty",00:02:38.560,00:02:44.860
"felt like doing that
you know if something is wrong",00:02:44.860,00:02:49.000
"runs in a country and if you think
that its a fellow man",00:02:49.000,00:02:55.860
"is wronged then you have it
duty as a citizen of the country",00:02:55.860,00:03:00.220
"to get up and say his opinion
I have expressed criticism but criticism",00:03:00.220,00:03:04.750
"was not destructive it was constructive
meant and so it remains today",00:03:04.750,00:03:11.829

a lock down in many countries",00:03:11.829,00:03:17.370
"have almost imposed the economy
said zero shutdown",00:03:17.370,00:03:22.570
"initially the measures were in the
first days and weeks with caution",00:03:22.570,00:03:28.000
"certainly justified but from today's
they are no longer visible",00:03:28.000,00:03:31.930
"why now i mean my church at all
a lock down makes sense at all",00:03:31.930,00:03:38.019

apart",00:03:38.019,00:03:40.190

written",00:03:40.190,00:03:44.450

why this opinion suddenly changed",00:03:44.450,00:03:50.180
"was three months later
be a secret i never have",00:03:50.180,00:03:55.310
"advocated but I would have understood
for that in the first weeks",00:03:55.310,00:03:59.570
"I have said that repeatedly
not to blame the government",00:03:59.570,00:04:04.640
"do
only you know the fact is and that",00:04:04.640,00:04:10.370
"is so clear from professor homburg
set out in the last few days",00:04:10.370,00:04:14.900
"that the epidemic was already ebbing away
when this came loose and that's it",00:04:14.900,00:04:22.850
"almost out of order
in my view and that was the reason",00:04:22.850,00:04:26.000
"which is why I commented on the
epidemic end of march was already on",00:04:26.000,00:04:34.640
"take off and is still taking off
contrary to all claims",00:04:34.640,00:04:41.090
"this is the case
and that's why there was a lure",00:04:41.090,00:04:44.930
"actually very questionable
and meaning and would definitely have",00:04:44.930,00:04:51.620
"two weeks ago or ten days ago
must be lifted",00:04:51.620,00:04:57.100
"but thatâ€™s not how
many governments argue that",00:04:57.100,00:05:02.870
"just because of the lockdown the epidemic
I think it's quick",00:05:02.870,00:05:08.030
"who finally realized that
this lockdown could not achieve anything",00:05:08.030,00:05:12.740
"also didn't come too late
and if you are very sober",00:05:12.740,00:05:16.840
"for example, Sweden
Sweden is the only country",00:05:16.840,00:05:21.400
"Others have had the courage to go there
do than everyone else",00:05:21.400,00:05:26.740
"nothing else happened in
Sweden",00:05:26.740,00:05:29.660

sorry ancona dead like here in",00:05:29.660,00:05:34.790
"Germany
and all this excitement and turmoil",00:05:34.790,00:05:40.140
"has been in vain
the shutdowns were imposed by the",00:05:40.140,00:05:47.070
"governments because it was said that
the corona virus is particularly dangerous",00:05:47.070,00:05:51.390
"therefore, the central question is yes
still how dangerous is this",00:05:51.390,00:05:55.920
"virus because actually when I went to
I first expressed milk",00:05:55.920,00:06:01.080
"just raised this question and
said before we pay clear",00:06:01.080,00:06:06.750
"we can pay sharp information
do nothing because of",00:06:06.750,00:06:13.950
"extrapolations extrapolations are always
speculative and you can't",00:06:13.950,00:06:20.220
"make important decisions based on
of projections and the first question",00:06:20.220,00:06:25.520
"that was also the first one I ask
the chancellor asked",00:06:25.520,00:06:30.710
"how do you differentiate between someone
the victory is delivered because of",00:06:30.710,00:06:38.310
"an infection is severe or with
how do they differentiate that was the second",00:06:38.310,00:06:45.060
"ask if someone with or on the virus
has died",00:06:45.060,00:06:49.580
"and before you really try to
clarify bring all projections",00:06:49.580,00:06:56.070
"nothing also has the number of infections
the new infections say nothing in themselves",00:06:56.070,00:07:01.430
"want to say something again what I already have
once said",00:07:01.430,00:07:06.120
"being an agent virus can be very, very
be dangerous eg rabies you have one",00:07:06.120,00:07:13.980
"man with rabies these people
to die",00:07:13.980,00:07:16.650
"they have a million people who should
adds a million will die",00:07:16.650,00:07:23.059
"obviously co will be somewhere
in between but where and this",00:07:23.059,00:07:28.919
"it was an obligation to determine
actually and this obligation was not",00:07:28.919,00:07:34.319
"not met by the medical profession
from the ministry of health",00:07:34.319,00:07:40.039
"fulfilling this duty was the first
duty that had to be fulfilled",00:07:40.039,00:07:45.779
"not done until now either
nevertheless we have enough data now",00:07:45.779,00:07:53.909
"now have enough data to say that
funny 19 not a dangerous to the public",00:07:53.909,00:08:00.809
"is bios and because enough data was available
probably has the most prestigious",00:08:00.809,00:08:08.629
"researchers in this field in the world
john joannidis in stanford",00:08:08.629,00:08:14.269
"he directs that she teaches us
he had no science",00:08:14.269,00:08:22.860
"I then voiced that it was the fourth
april or i said people i have",00:08:22.860,00:08:27.809
"now the data collected and viewed
put together that maybe we",00:08:27.809,00:08:32.009
"very briefly you may have to do that
broad audience say weir",00:08:32.009,00:08:36.779
"joannidis is just
Stanford professor is one of the",00:08:36.779,00:08:40.169
"most cited scientists worldwide
he was responsible for the quality of his",00:08:40.169,00:08:43.949
"research and the accuracy of its
also testified several times and",00:08:43.949,00:08:48.959
"he is now planning this study
released in a few days",00:08:48.959,00:08:53.009
"an impressive person what he did
has he said the whole world",00:08:53.009,00:08:59.870
"does not differentiate between with or on
and that's why I have problems with",00:08:59.870,00:09:05.610
"had in advance but on the fourth of april
said the numbers unadjusted",00:09:05.610,00:09:10.350
"enough for me
and that's a word that means who",00:09:10.350,00:09:13.800
"took the numbers and took them there
said how many people over 80",00:09:13.800,00:09:19.889
"years are
have an absolute risk to cupid 19 too",00:09:19.889,00:09:26.350
"die during this epidemic by
fourth of april was the number 22 per 10,000",00:09:26.350,00:09:36.490
"that means two people over 80 years
whether from 10,000 to 80 years are on",00:09:36.490,00:09:44.140
"cupid 19 died during this period
the epidemic if you watch how much",00:09:44.140,00:09:51.460
"So today is two and a half three weeks
later that number is seven i have",00:09:51.460,00:09:57.880
"recalculated
now they want to say they are prosieben",00:09:57.880,00:10:01.750
"but seven too many because everyone is dead
to complain",00:10:01.750,00:10:05.860
"because I say yes it is so you only have to
relate this number",00:10:05.860,00:10:12.700
"to completely different numbers that exist
if we land here over 80",00:10:12.700,00:10:20.560

what would we have",00:10:20.560,00:10:25.810

probability of dying",00:10:32.760,00:10:41.310
"That is the way our life is
actually ended with 100 and from",00:10:41.310,00:10:49.750

will die this year",00:10:49.750,00:10:55.240

"die outside or inside the
hospitals that is 120 out of 10,000",00:11:03.330,00:11:12.210
"if you put this 120
against seven to eight cupid 19 dead",00:11:12.210,00:11:19.780

may rise to 8 19",00:11:28.270,00:11:34.060

19 may contribute ten to that",00:11:40.710,00:11:48.250
