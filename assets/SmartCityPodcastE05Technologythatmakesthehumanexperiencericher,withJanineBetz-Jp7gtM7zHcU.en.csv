"In this episode of The Smart City
Podcast",00:00:01.700,00:00:03.280
I had a great conversation,00:00:03.890,00:00:04.489
"with a fellow member of the Smart
Cities",00:00:05.210,00:00:07.030
"Council Emerging Innovators Group
Janine",00:00:07.320,00:00:08.955
Betz.,00:00:09.880,00:00:09.930
"I'll start by saying that everything
we discussed",00:00:10.940,00:00:12.589
is personal opinion only,00:00:13.100,00:00:14.089
"and does not represent the companies
we work",00:00:14.450,00:00:16.459
for,00:00:16.460,00:00:16.850
and is not associated in any way,00:00:17.450,00:00:18.919
with these companies.,00:00:19.100,00:00:20.090
"Now with that out of the way,",00:00:20.450,00:00:21.620
Janine is a passionate advocate,00:00:21.800,00:00:22.999
for sustainability,00:00:23.630,00:00:24.740
and using Smart techniques,00:00:24.770,00:00:26.360
"to help fight against climate
change.",00:00:26.690,00:00:28.910
"Western Australia is really lucky to
benefit",00:00:29.330,00:00:30.889
"from Janine's background as she
brings the",00:00:31.280,00:00:32.989
European approach to sustainability,00:00:33.110,00:00:35.060
"and molds it to suit the Australian
conditions",00:00:35.390,00:00:37.039
and environment.,00:00:37.580,00:00:38.240
We discussed about the challenges,00:00:38.990,00:00:40.219
"and opportunities building a six
star",00:00:40.760,00:00:42.469
Green Star Rating project,00:00:42.770,00:00:44.270
"and how Smart Cities is about the
integration",00:00:44.570,00:00:46.279
between sustainability,00:00:46.910,00:00:47.239
and innovation.,00:00:48.080,00:00:48.920
Janine also talks passionately about,00:00:49.640,00:00:51.500
"Western Australia finding its feet
in terms",00:00:51.800,00:00:53.539
"of culture, growth",00:00:53.780,00:00:54.680
"and identity,",00:00:54.710,00:00:55.640
and how Western Australia is well on,00:00:55.940,00:00:57.619
their way to leading certain aspects,00:00:57.770,00:00:59.119
of Smart Cities.,00:00:59.660,00:01:00.070
As always I really hope you enjoy,00:01:01.160,00:01:02.899
listening to this episode as much as,00:01:03.200,00:01:04.909
I enjoyed making it.,00:01:05.060,00:01:06.080
"[The Smart City Podcast Intro
Music.]",00:01:06.700,00:01:07.810
Well let's jump straight into,00:01:32.590,00:01:34.169
this and in order,00:01:34.530,00:01:36.239
"to introduce yourself,",00:01:36.420,00:01:37.620
"can you tell us a little bit about
your background?",00:01:37.680,00:01:40.080
"Yes, sure.",00:01:40.690,00:01:40.740
So you'll probably notice very,00:01:41.540,00:01:43.289
"quickly that I have a bit of an
accent",00:01:43.560,00:01:45.810
and I am indeed not from,00:01:45.860,00:01:47.549
Australia. I was born,00:01:47.760,00:01:48.449
and raised in Germany,00:01:48.690,00:01:49.319
and have been here since 2007.,00:01:49.830,00:01:52.410
I have an engineering background,00:01:52.710,00:01:54.120
with a Major in Architecture,00:01:55.310,00:01:56.240
"and Urban Design, and a Post-Grad.",00:01:56.720,00:01:58.460
Certificate in Sustainability,00:01:59.270,00:02:00.020
and Climate Policy.,00:02:01.050,00:02:02.010
I currently work for the,00:02:03.450,00:02:05.310
LendLease communities business,00:02:05.320,00:02:07.200
in the WA.,00:02:07.280,00:02:07.740
"Yeah, wow, cool.",00:02:08.699,00:02:09.680
So Janine,00:02:09.780,00:02:10.769
and I are part of the,00:02:10.830,00:02:12.420
Smart Cities Council Emerging,00:02:12.970,00:02:14.369
"Innovators Group. That's how we kind
of got",00:02:14.850,00:02:16.619
to know each other.,00:02:16.800,00:02:17.610
So what sparked,00:02:17.650,00:02:19.079
your interest in Smart Cities?,00:02:19.500,00:02:20.720
Well I think that the conversation,00:02:21.330,00:02:22.829
about Smart Cities is possibly,00:02:23.490,00:02:25.229
one of the most important,00:02:25.800,00:02:27.269
ones occurring at this point,00:02:27.810,00:02:29.399
in time. As we know climate,00:02:29.670,00:02:31.349
change and sustainability as a,00:02:31.710,00:02:33.600
whole is a challenge of,00:02:33.960,00:02:35.810
our time.,00:02:36.240,00:02:36.900
And I'm just very keen to be,00:02:37.350,00:02:39.420
part of that.,00:02:39.540,00:02:40.380
And I guess coming,00:02:40.470,00:02:42.360
"to Australia as an outsider,",00:02:42.990,00:02:44.450
"I have a bit of,",00:02:44.480,00:02:45.690
kind of two perspectives.,00:02:46.040,00:02:47.320
You know one that is very,00:02:47.380,00:02:49.380
much shaped by,00:02:49.620,00:02:51.780
"the European approach,",00:02:52.440,00:02:53.760
which is very,00:02:53.790,00:02:55.690
much around different countries,00:02:56.130,00:02:57.599
working together,00:02:58.050,00:02:59.040
and that in combination,00:02:59.400,00:03:00.809
"with the Australian perspective
where we're",00:03:01.410,00:03:03.079
"quite isolated geographically,",00:03:03.330,00:03:05.760
"I think that's something that's
always",00:03:06.630,00:03:08.369
on my mind as to how I,00:03:08.670,00:03:10.590
sort of balance the two,00:03:11.070,00:03:12.629
mindsets. And that has,00:03:12.900,00:03:15.170
I guess prompted me to,00:03:15.600,00:03:16.610
be involved,00:03:18.150,00:03:18.960
and just share some of the insights,00:03:19.020,00:03:20.609
that I get through,00:03:21.060,00:03:22.380
being in touch,00:03:23.580,00:03:24.270
"with my home country,",00:03:24.590,00:03:26.250
"which is Germany, whilst also
working in",00:03:26.280,00:03:28.079
Australia.,00:03:28.230,00:03:28.760
Cool. Are there any particular,00:03:29.220,00:03:30.629
technologies,00:03:31.500,00:03:31.550
or concepts that you've come across,00:03:32.370,00:03:33.899
"that you're really interested or are
already",00:03:34.350,00:03:35.639
exploring?,00:03:36.510,00:03:37.200
Yeah so for me it's really--,00:03:37.590,00:03:39.240
Smart Cities really involves around,00:03:39.820,00:03:41.700
the human experience.,00:03:41.880,00:03:43.270
To me people are the central,00:03:43.290,00:03:44.819
aspects of how we design our city.,00:03:45.270,00:03:47.250
"Obviously I'm going to say that,",00:03:47.460,00:03:48.359
I'm an architect so,00:03:48.570,00:03:50.490
"you know how can we use technology
to make",00:03:51.060,00:03:52.799
the experience of our urban,00:03:53.070,00:03:54.930
fabric richer.,00:03:55.740,00:03:56.700
And obviously in the beginning,00:03:57.210,00:03:58.559
Building Information Modelling has,00:03:59.130,00:04:00.809
been around in,00:04:01.080,00:04:02.830
Europe for quite some time.,00:04:02.960,00:04:04.190
I wrote my thesis on that in,00:04:04.200,00:04:05.630
2006,00:04:06.240,00:04:07.410
and there was already a trend,00:04:07.440,00:04:09.120
in Europe and has since become,00:04:09.570,00:04:11.850
a trend in Australia.,00:04:12.120,00:04:13.260
"So that,",00:04:13.320,00:04:14.130
"you know, I guess at",00:04:14.220,00:04:15.200
"the building level is something that
I'm really",00:04:16.110,00:04:17.729
"interested in, and how can we
utilize that",00:04:17.970,00:04:19.919
technology (BIM) to really,00:04:19.920,00:04:21.150
have a Smart system,00:04:21.779,00:04:24.180
"whereby we know everything about our
buildings",00:04:24.390,00:04:26.730
beyond the construction itself,00:04:26.790,00:04:29.220
but also technologies,00:04:29.790,00:04:31.289
that allow us to map,00:04:32.160,00:04:33.420
and model human behaviour,00:04:33.450,00:04:35.460
and then facilitate,00:04:36.030,00:04:37.199
a participatory design,00:04:38.010,00:04:39.510
approach to really ensure,00:04:39.870,00:04:41.369
that we speak to the right people,00:04:41.790,00:04:43.680
at the right time,00:04:44.100,00:04:44.579
and get positive outcomes.,00:04:44.970,00:04:46.500
So really to me technology is a way,00:04:46.830,00:04:48.539
of getting,00:04:48.840,00:04:50.490
to a point where we,00:04:50.850,00:04:52.830
design cities,00:04:53.280,00:04:55.080
in a way that they improve,00:04:55.380,00:04:57.630
the experience that the citizen,00:04:57.870,00:04:59.579
has.,00:05:00.030,00:05:00.450
Yeah cool yeah.,00:05:00.640,00:05:02.000
I'm really interested in BIM,00:05:02.190,00:05:03.824
"as well-- so Building Information
Modelling--",00:05:04.080,00:05:05.590
from a horizontal perspective,00:05:06.690,00:05:08.580
because I think vertical,00:05:08.610,00:05:10.170
"buildings and that kind of thing,",00:05:10.530,00:05:12.030
it's quite advanced.,00:05:12.620,00:05:14.220
Whereas I see so much potential,00:05:14.310,00:05:15.869
for roads and bridges,00:05:16.530,00:05:18.300
and our horizontal infrastructure,00:05:18.960,00:05:20.940
to know where the services,00:05:21.620,00:05:23.279
"are, so you know your water",00:05:24.090,00:05:25.739
"pipes and all that kind of stuff,",00:05:26.040,00:05:27.630
that real integrated approach not,00:05:27.930,00:05:29.549
just with the buildings,00:05:29.760,00:05:31.110
"but all this other infrastructure
that",00:05:31.140,00:05:32.939
we have running under our feet,00:05:33.060,00:05:34.500
or under our wheels of our cars,00:05:34.620,00:05:36.510
and that kind of thing.,00:05:36.540,00:05:37.380
Yeah I 100% agree.,00:05:37.740,00:05:38.849
It's really a holistic approach,00:05:39.210,00:05:40.859
that looks at the whole city as it,00:05:41.280,00:05:43.100
relates to buildings individually.,00:05:43.140,00:05:44.111
But how do they relate to,00:05:44.560,00:05:46.199
"each other, how do they interact",00:05:46.380,00:05:47.810
and how do you link that to the,00:05:48.210,00:05:49.979
infrastructure?,00:05:50.100,00:05:50.820
"You know, the horizontal element
that you've",00:05:51.070,00:05:52.739
mentioned.,00:05:52.890,00:05:53.390
"So that's something,",00:05:53.960,00:05:55.560
I think it's quite exciting.,00:05:56.420,00:05:57.600
There's a lot of really cool stuff,00:05:57.960,00:05:59.699
already happening in,00:06:00.060,00:06:02.170
Europe and certainly you know,00:06:02.190,00:06:04.080
big land development projects,00:06:04.290,00:06:05.909
in the Middle East as well.,00:06:06.330,00:06:07.590
Where you can then add,00:06:08.310,00:06:09.130
the human element into it,00:06:10.420,00:06:12.370
and really allow,00:06:12.720,00:06:14.379
technology to sort of assist,00:06:14.950,00:06:16.539
the process of design from,00:06:16.900,00:06:18.620
the beginning but also,00:06:19.270,00:06:20.380
"at the refinement stage,",00:06:22.030,00:06:22.869
when sometimes projects don't,00:06:23.320,00:06:25.100
work as well as,00:06:25.230,00:06:26.440
they were intended to,00:06:28.150,00:06:29.760
or people invent new,00:06:29.716,00:06:31.509
ways of using the spaces,00:06:31.780,00:06:33.279
that you create.,00:06:33.760,00:06:34.380
So I think,00:06:34.630,00:06:35.860
if we get to that point where,00:06:36.940,00:06:38.590
we have that participation,00:06:39.890,00:06:41.650
from a user perspective,00:06:41.890,00:06:43.330
and feed that data back,00:06:43.690,00:06:45.279
"into the models that we create,",00:06:45.550,00:06:47.100
we have a real--,00:06:47.140,00:06:47.860
a lifecycle really,00:06:49.290,00:06:50.680
"of data that starts at design
inception",00:06:51.130,00:06:52.839
construction to the maintenance,00:06:53.320,00:06:55.930
and the usage,00:06:56.200,00:06:57.579
of,00:06:58.160,00:06:58.410
our cities.,00:07:00.100,00:07:00.710
"Yeah, definitely.",00:07:01.220,00:07:01.270
So let's talk about right now.,00:07:02.560,00:07:04.180
What are some of the projects,00:07:05.050,00:07:05.769
and things you're working on?,00:07:06.450,00:07:07.660
So through the work that I'm doing,00:07:08.430,00:07:10.390
with Lend Lease I'm involved,00:07:10.510,00:07:11.679
with a very exciting project,00:07:12.100,00:07:14.050
called Alkimos Beach.,00:07:14.560,00:07:15.480
It is the first project in Australia,00:07:15.730,00:07:17.680
to receive these six star,00:07:17.710,00:07:19.630
rating from the Green Building,00:07:19.810,00:07:21.369
"Council of Australia,",00:07:21.700,00:07:22.930
and as part,00:07:23.435,00:07:25.370
of that we obviously have a whole,00:07:25.630,00:07:27.339
lot of commitments that,00:07:27.610,00:07:29.440
we've made and,00:07:29.790,00:07:30.910
that certification,00:07:31.630,00:07:31.839
and the commitments that come,00:07:32.650,00:07:33.429
with that really inform every single,00:07:33.700,00:07:35.379
decision that we make along,00:07:35.740,00:07:37.630
the way. So it's a very,00:07:37.780,00:07:39.610
interesting project that will run,00:07:39.820,00:07:41.469
for a few more years,00:07:41.710,00:07:42.940
and we have just,00:07:43.450,00:07:45.040
launched a new project,00:07:46.120,00:07:47.770
also here in WA,00:07:48.010,00:07:48.770
called Alkimos Vista.,00:07:49.930,00:07:50.790
"Both projects are very close to the
coast",00:07:51.555,00:07:53.139
so indeed as we're speaking now,00:07:53.500,00:07:55.269
"I'm actually looking out to the
ocean,",00:07:55.570,00:07:57.400
"because our beautiful sales office
is",00:07:57.650,00:07:59.510
in a really good spot.,00:07:59.900,00:08:01.090
I guess greenfield development,00:08:02.290,00:08:04.300
really needs to be,00:08:04.330,00:08:06.700
at the forefront in many ways,00:08:06.960,00:08:08.679
of considering Smart because,00:08:09.010,00:08:10.840
I feel we've got a responsibility,00:08:11.320,00:08:13.510
to be as Smart as we can,00:08:13.540,00:08:15.099
in terms of future-proofing the,00:08:15.490,00:08:16.010
communities that we create.,00:08:17.620,00:08:19.130
"And it is something that we are
thinking about",00:08:19.480,00:08:21.490
not only here in WA,00:08:21.550,00:08:22.460
but LendLease as a business,00:08:22.905,00:08:24.880
"more broadly,",00:08:24.970,00:08:25.720
not only in property,00:08:26.110,00:08:27.340
but across the different,00:08:27.400,00:08:29.530
businesses and areas that we,00:08:30.190,00:08:31.959
are operating in.,00:08:32.140,00:08:32.950
But speaking about,00:08:33.400,00:08:35.289
"communities there are obviously
strategies",00:08:35.330,00:08:36.879
in place that are specifically,00:08:37.390,00:08:38.640
aimed at creating,00:08:39.429,00:08:41.350
Smart communities,00:08:41.630,00:08:42.940
and things like fibre to the home,00:08:43.330,00:08:45.040
etc. are already,00:08:45.150,00:08:46.930
in place in most communities,00:08:47.410,00:08:49.600
including Alkimos Beach.,00:08:49.630,00:08:50.510
So that's the project that,00:08:51.550,00:08:53.470
I am most intimately involved with.,00:08:53.590,00:08:55.240
But I also manage,00:08:55.270,00:08:57.009
"the innovation framework for
LendLease",00:08:57.310,00:08:59.280
property in WA,00:08:59.375,00:08:59.890
and as part of that global,00:09:00.610,00:09:02.470
group of project,00:09:02.475,00:09:04.110
leads and guides across,00:09:04.510,00:09:06.580
"the world really,",00:09:06.790,00:09:08.289
I get snippets of what LendLease,00:09:08.790,00:09:10.325
is working on through their,00:09:11.050,00:09:12.639
innovation arm.,00:09:13.030,00:09:13.161
It's quite interesting.,00:09:15.320,00:09:16.540
"While sorry I can't share too many
details",00:09:17.110,00:09:19.090
but it is,00:09:19.120,00:09:20.680
quite good to get,00:09:20.970,00:09:22.660
that insight.,00:09:22.870,00:09:23.645
"Yeah, definitely.",00:09:24.130,00:09:25.320
I know you will obviously,00:09:25.530,00:09:27.309
be restricted.,00:09:27.790,00:09:28.540
I totally understand,00:09:28.780,00:09:29.220
"with the amount of details,",00:09:30.200,00:09:31.210
but the project that,00:09:31.240,00:09:33.060
"you mentioned,",00:09:33.070,00:09:34.030
is some key aspects you can,00:09:34.360,00:09:36.610
tell us about that really,00:09:38.230,00:09:40.150
set it apart from other projects,00:09:40.320,00:09:42.700
to get that six start rating?,00:09:42.970,00:09:44.401
Well there's,00:09:44.670,00:09:45.180
many different aspects,00:09:46.570,00:09:48.430
"to it. And they range,",00:09:48.490,00:09:50.050
obviously it's an environmental,00:09:50.060,00:09:51.760
rating. Well,00:09:52.010,00:09:52.060
"at least that's how many people
understand",00:09:53.980,00:09:55.389
"it. However it actually goes far
beyond",00:09:56.020,00:09:58.240
"the environmental aspect of it,",00:09:58.300,00:09:59.860
it goes on to,00:10:00.820,00:10:02.370
"the community aspect,",00:10:02.770,00:10:03.399
to the economic aspect.,00:10:03.790,00:10:05.770
So our commitments,00:10:06.280,00:10:07.560
and therefore our initiatives,00:10:08.340,00:10:10.330
on the ground they,00:10:10.410,00:10:12.190
range from,00:10:12.340,00:10:13.390
something like a solar battery,00:10:14.410,00:10:16.029
"storage, which we have on",00:10:16.420,00:10:18.109
site at the moment.,00:10:18.330,00:10:19.540
It's a trial in Australia,00:10:19.960,00:10:21.369
which is unique,00:10:21.790,00:10:23.560
and we are conducting,00:10:24.040,00:10:25.569
that in collaboration,00:10:26.140,00:10:27.009
with various government agencies,00:10:27.700,00:10:29.049
or service providers here in WA.,00:10:29.680,00:10:30.880
That's one of the,00:10:32.020,00:10:33.750
highlights of the project.,00:10:34.420,00:10:36.210
So we mandate solar,00:10:36.250,00:10:38.470
hot water systems,00:10:38.740,00:10:39.129
"and solar PV systems on every single
home.",00:10:39.610,00:10:41.860
That's one,00:10:42.760,00:10:44.360
thing.,00:10:44.620,00:10:44.980
The other one is of course,00:10:45.140,00:10:47.140
the use of recycled materials,00:10:47.560,00:10:50.050
onsite.,00:10:50.130,00:10:50.660
We have a recycling program,00:10:51.130,00:10:52.929
"in place, which the builders",00:10:53.440,00:10:55.600
can utilise on site,00:10:55.780,00:10:57.940
so that diverts landfill.,00:10:58.210,00:10:59.710
Up to 90% of construction,00:11:00.050,00:11:01.950
waste is diverted from landfill.,00:11:01.955,00:11:03.580
You know the list goes on,00:11:04.270,00:11:05.919
"and on. I could talk for a very long
time.",00:11:06.070,00:11:08.120
But we have got a designated,00:11:08.200,00:11:10.020
sustainability manager who manages,00:11:10.260,00:11:12.750
our commitment,00:11:13.050,00:11:13.860
that we have in terms of,00:11:15.320,00:11:16.980
maintaining that credit.,00:11:17.220,00:11:18.610
And she is sort of the interface,00:11:18.900,00:11:20.519
between us and the GBCA.,00:11:21.030,00:11:22.100
But it's very much something,00:11:23.130,00:11:25.020
"as a project team,",00:11:25.440,00:11:27.010
if you have a rating,00:11:27.390,00:11:28.405
or certification like like a,00:11:28.530,00:11:30.420
"6-star Green Star Rating,",00:11:30.430,00:11:31.400
it's not something that you can,00:11:32.130,00:11:33.810
just achieve,00:11:33.990,00:11:35.040
and then you drop it.,00:11:35.370,00:11:37.120
It's an ongoing commitment,00:11:37.630,00:11:39.900
and it requires,00:11:40.050,00:11:41.400
"buy in from everybody at any point
in",00:11:42.030,00:11:43.799
time because it is sometimes,00:11:43.890,00:11:46.020
"a bit restrictive in the decisions
that",00:11:46.200,00:11:47.999
you can make whilst you're,00:11:48.180,00:11:50.010
developing a projects.,00:11:50.310,00:11:51.630
"Because you've made that commitment
so you",00:11:51.960,00:11:53.549
obviously need to make sure,00:11:54.090,00:11:55.769
that there's no breach,00:11:56.100,00:11:57.689
of that.,00:11:58.020,00:11:58.530
So as a result you need,00:11:58.980,00:12:00.830
"people who are committed,",00:12:00.870,00:12:01.679
"who are driven and understand the
importance",00:12:02.100,00:12:03.629
"of it because what we've found is
that often",00:12:04.290,00:12:06.510
people don't necessarily,00:12:06.870,00:12:08.219
understand what it actually,00:12:08.940,00:12:10.649
means to try to develop a carbon,00:12:11.010,00:12:12.629
neutral green field development.,00:12:13.080,00:12:15.420
So there is a lot of education that,00:12:15.900,00:12:17.519
still needs to take place,00:12:17.760,00:12:19.650
as well.,00:12:20.070,00:12:20.550
But getting back to Smart,00:12:20.880,00:12:22.700
"components,",00:12:23.100,00:12:23.990
the fact that we have got fibre to,00:12:24.480,00:12:26.220
"every single home here at Alkimos
Beach",00:12:26.760,00:12:28.340
and really good connectivity,00:12:29.190,00:12:31.200
"and Wi-Fi coverage,",00:12:31.590,00:12:33.030
then of course enables us to,00:12:33.210,00:12:35.250
rollout technologies that,00:12:35.520,00:12:37.259
we may be working on to make,00:12:37.500,00:12:39.149
the city or the area,00:12:39.420,00:12:40.950
more Smart,00:12:41.610,00:12:42.370
"Yeah, cool.",00:12:42.520,00:12:42.570
"Can you give us an example of some
of the",00:12:43.680,00:12:45.540
Smart tech you're thinking,00:12:45.550,00:12:47.099
"about implementing,",00:12:47.460,00:12:47.699
"or some of the Smart tech,",00:12:48.390,00:12:49.045
"even if it's not in this projuct,",00:12:49.410,00:12:50.936
"some of the Smart tech that you
think is interesting",00:12:51.380,00:12:53.630
that should be implemented?,00:12:53.640,00:12:54.840
Yeah well that,00:12:55.200,00:12:57.060
I guess will very quickly go,00:12:57.090,00:12:58.829
on for me to share a challenge,00:12:59.070,00:13:01.320
I guess with you.,00:13:01.350,00:13:02.190
For example Smart bins is,00:13:03.540,00:13:05.249
something that we see elsewhere,00:13:05.430,00:13:07.109
in the world already implemented,00:13:07.590,00:13:09.210
and we sometimes,00:13:09.630,00:13:10.919
run into problems,00:13:11.640,00:13:12.059
with local governments,00:13:12.510,00:13:13.740
to actually see the value,00:13:14.370,00:13:16.590
in Smart bins in their parks.,00:13:16.710,00:13:18.690
Because every park that we develop,00:13:18.960,00:13:21.120
in a project will then eventually,00:13:21.300,00:13:23.069
be handed over to the respective,00:13:23.640,00:13:25.680
council.,00:13:26.310,00:13:26.910
Now if they don't see value in,00:13:27.240,00:13:28.559
those assets they may,00:13:29.100,00:13:31.110
not want those assets in their parks,00:13:32.010,00:13:34.200
basically.,00:13:34.230,00:13:34.910
So whilst this is,00:13:35.370,00:13:37.260
"just to give you that example of
Smart bins,",00:13:37.320,00:13:39.142
"that's something that we really want
to drive.",00:13:39.480,00:13:41.560
And we know that in other,00:13:41.940,00:13:43.499
areas in Australia this is less,00:13:43.800,00:13:45.419
of a problem.,00:13:45.660,00:13:46.360
But certainly here in WA,00:13:46.740,00:13:47.960
"we're still having to-- With this
particular",00:13:48.870,00:13:51.060
council there's still a bit of,00:13:51.300,00:13:53.040
consultation that needs to occur.,00:13:53.970,00:13:55.980
And then of course you,00:13:56.370,00:13:58.020
talk about Smart poles.,00:13:58.850,00:14:00.243
So the ability to install,00:14:00.450,00:14:02.790
light poles that not only,00:14:02.880,00:14:04.590
"are Smart in their energy
efficiency,",00:14:05.020,00:14:07.110
"like LEDs, but also",00:14:07.440,00:14:09.000
"record traffic data,",00:14:09.450,00:14:11.580
they might record the wind direction,00:14:11.780,00:14:14.070
which is important to inform,00:14:14.100,00:14:16.260
the sand drift management,00:14:16.710,00:14:19.080
strategy,00:14:19.440,00:14:20.250
and things like that.,00:14:20.970,00:14:21.780
So yes there is quite,00:14:21.810,00:14:23.549
a bit of technology already,00:14:23.790,00:14:25.379
available,00:14:25.710,00:14:26.460
and we're certainly,00:14:26.820,00:14:28.379
"watching that space very closely to
see",00:14:28.830,00:14:30.509
what we can implement.,00:14:30.780,00:14:31.800
Yeah definitely.,00:14:32.040,00:14:33.030
Let's focus on Western Australia.,00:14:33.300,00:14:35.310
"Do you think that Western Australia
ranks",00:14:35.350,00:14:37.590
"fairly high when it comes to Smart
Cities",00:14:38.220,00:14:39.830
or certain aspects of Smart Cities?,00:14:40.170,00:14:41.630
Well certain aspects yes.,00:14:42.180,00:14:43.610
I mean there are areas in WA,00:14:43.740,00:14:45.840
that are extremely progressive,00:14:46.250,00:14:48.030
"and I'm maybe biased because I
happen",00:14:48.060,00:14:49.769
to live in Fremantle,00:14:49.980,00:14:50.940
"but the city of Fremantle is
actually",00:14:50.970,00:14:52.559
quite progressive.,00:14:52.950,00:14:53.880
They also have a One,00:14:54.110,00:14:55.910
Planet Living certification,00:14:56.070,00:14:57.720
and of course the very famous,00:14:57.750,00:15:00.120
"White Gum Valley Project,",00:15:00.210,00:15:01.680
"which trials a whole range of
different",00:15:02.340,00:15:04.230
innovative things,00:15:04.410,00:15:05.350
with the CRC,00:15:05.480,00:15:07.440
for low carbon living,00:15:07.740,00:15:08.820
and those examples really,00:15:09.390,00:15:11.430
provide a bit of hope,00:15:11.550,00:15:13.500
I guess in that there,00:15:13.680,00:15:15.449
is a recognition of,00:15:15.720,00:15:17.280
"the need for action among
government.",00:15:18.000,00:15:20.220
I would say however that,00:15:20.730,00:15:22.470
in Australia generally,00:15:22.710,00:15:24.510
we're probably ranking,00:15:24.720,00:15:26.262
maybe mid level when it,00:15:26.730,00:15:28.439
comes to our commitment,00:15:28.560,00:15:30.329
to driving Smart cities.,00:15:30.870,00:15:32.600
"Certainly when you compare it to,",00:15:32.640,00:15:34.410
"say Europe,",00:15:34.530,00:15:35.670
where the EU as a body,00:15:36.150,00:15:38.010
really drives it through initiatives,00:15:38.160,00:15:40.470
"like the Climate-KIC,",00:15:40.530,00:15:41.090
the Europe,00:15:41.940,00:15:43.830
"Innovation Partnership,",00:15:43.860,00:15:44.810
I think it's called EIP.,00:15:44.766,00:15:46.580
And they have long accepted,00:15:47.340,00:15:49.139
that climate change exists,00:15:49.650,00:15:51.300
and they have prioritised I guess,00:15:51.390,00:15:53.130
actions to mitigate the,00:15:53.790,00:15:55.559
risk of climate change.,00:15:55.680,00:15:57.090
And that I think has,00:15:57.460,00:15:59.129
yet to happen,00:15:59.340,00:16:00.300
to that degree in Australia.,00:16:01.530,00:16:03.780
Yeah definitely.,00:16:04.050,00:16:05.160
So you see the,00:16:05.620,00:16:06.660
Smart City space as kind of an,00:16:07.470,00:16:08.860
integration between,00:16:09.580,00:16:10.840
sustainability,00:16:12.580,00:16:12.630
"and innovation,",00:16:13.660,00:16:14.790
would that be about right?,00:16:14.950,00:16:15.740
"Yeah I think that's a really good
point.",00:16:16.270,00:16:17.770
And I think that-- I,00:16:18.280,00:16:20.079
"mean, innovation",00:16:20.140,00:16:21.610
and Smart,00:16:22.150,00:16:22.770
"and sustainability have sort of gone
through that",00:16:22.960,00:16:24.759
cycle of being buzzwords.,00:16:24.850,00:16:25.890
And there's a lot of greenwash,00:16:27.170,00:16:29.080
"and there will be a lot of-- I don't
know,",00:16:29.370,00:16:30.879
what would be the equivalent term,00:16:30.880,00:16:32.439
for what green wash would be for,00:16:32.800,00:16:34.690
Smart. Maybe Smartwash?,00:16:34.700,00:16:35.860
But I think that,00:16:37.480,00:16:39.220
"you've got to be really really
careful as well",00:16:39.760,00:16:41.529
as how to use those terms.,00:16:41.830,00:16:43.360
But what I also,00:16:43.420,00:16:44.859
think it's you know innovation.,00:16:45.250,00:16:47.440
"In Australia quite often we get
really",00:16:47.860,00:16:49.629
excited about things that we,00:16:49.900,00:16:51.339
consider innovative,00:16:51.760,00:16:52.720
"and yes they're quite innovative for
Australia.",00:16:52.750,00:16:55.080
But if we apply a broader,00:16:55.360,00:16:57.400
lens,00:16:57.490,00:16:58.090
and look to other countries then,00:16:58.390,00:17:00.700
a lot of what we consider,00:17:00.850,00:17:02.590
innovative is BAU,00:17:02.740,00:17:04.550
in other countries,00:17:05.920,00:17:07.119
where sustainability,00:17:07.750,00:17:08.108
"and innovation is already part of
the culture.",00:17:08.859,00:17:10.960
So we are such a Smart country in,00:17:11.319,00:17:13.269
"Australia,",00:17:13.270,00:17:13.960
really you know benefiting from,00:17:14.140,00:17:15.939
so many different backgrounds,00:17:16.240,00:17:18.250
culturally and,00:17:18.280,00:17:19.309
and I guess a professional point,00:17:19.369,00:17:21.129
of view.,00:17:21.400,00:17:21.870
"I really think that there's
potential",00:17:22.300,00:17:24.549
for us to be a leader,00:17:24.550,00:17:26.919
of Smart Cities once we we,00:17:27.099,00:17:28.930
have a shift of mindset,00:17:29.160,00:17:30.550
and concentrate our efforts,00:17:30.670,00:17:32.080
and decide where we want to go as a,00:17:32.530,00:17:34.329
country.,00:17:34.390,00:17:34.870
Yeah definitely.,00:17:35.110,00:17:36.100
"So do you think that Western
Australia is a good",00:17:36.350,00:17:38.019
place to pilot,00:17:38.260,00:17:40.330
Smart tech,00:17:40.460,00:17:41.229
and Smart concepts?,00:17:41.680,00:17:42.862
You know are they quite progressive,00:17:44.070,00:17:46.130
policy and regulation?,00:17:47.110,00:17:48.760
Well I think that,00:17:48.950,00:17:50.710
we do,00:17:51.230,00:17:53.019
benefit from a number,00:17:53.230,00:17:54.699
of young leaders,00:17:55.150,00:17:56.890
or emerging leaders.,00:17:57.340,00:17:58.690
I don't know what is the right term,00:17:58.810,00:18:00.520
in the government in,00:18:01.350,00:18:02.739
Australia. So we have obviously,00:18:03.190,00:18:04.869
"had a change of government recently,",00:18:05.290,00:18:07.570
"although I can't vote,",00:18:07.900,00:18:09.342
not being a citizen.,00:18:09.490,00:18:10.750
But there is certainly,00:18:11.830,00:18:14.110
great opportunity for change,00:18:14.520,00:18:15.920
and we are already seeing that.,00:18:15.930,00:18:17.230
"So I think,",00:18:17.440,00:18:18.220
"to answer your question,",00:18:18.250,00:18:19.120
yes there is great opportunity,00:18:19.150,00:18:20.289
here.,00:18:21.070,00:18:21.640
I really think that,00:18:21.880,00:18:23.670
"WA in particular,",00:18:23.940,00:18:26.170
"those who haven't been here
recently,",00:18:26.180,00:18:27.940
has experienced a very significant,00:18:28.450,00:18:30.910
growth in terms of its maturity,00:18:31.000,00:18:33.010
and certainly in the short time,00:18:33.100,00:18:34.809
"that I've been here-- just over 10
years--",00:18:35.080,00:18:36.549
the city has really changed,00:18:36.940,00:18:39.010
"very significantly,",00:18:39.190,00:18:40.290
"found its feet,",00:18:40.300,00:18:41.140
embraced its identity.,00:18:41.170,00:18:42.610
And not only from an,00:18:43.120,00:18:44.889
"urban development point of view,",00:18:45.010,00:18:46.990
"have great things happen,",00:18:47.050,00:18:48.220
"but that's been a bit of a shift of
mindset,",00:18:48.280,00:18:50.530
"I feel,",00:18:51.110,00:18:51.880
for people to actually embrace,00:18:52.300,00:18:54.009
"the fact that yes we're far away
from",00:18:54.490,00:18:56.139
everybody else,00:18:56.410,00:18:57.190
"and yes everyone thinks you've got
to",00:18:57.220,00:18:58.969
wait awhile for things to happen in,00:18:59.050,00:19:00.819
Australia and sometimes they do.,00:19:00.970,00:19:03.070
"But there is a bit of,",00:19:03.430,00:19:05.230
there's quite a good energy here,00:19:05.750,00:19:07.570
at this point in time.,00:19:07.600,00:19:08.590
So yeah I'm quite confident,00:19:08.620,00:19:10.750
that we'll make our mark.,00:19:11.020,00:19:11.255
"Yeah, cool. So do you think",00:19:12.670,00:19:14.110
"that we can better integrate across
the disciplines.",00:19:15.250,00:19:17.860
"You know, as in government,",00:19:18.950,00:19:20.680
"universities,",00:19:21.200,00:19:21.250
"industries or do you think they're
doing it quite",00:19:22.090,00:19:23.889
well in WA?,00:19:24.130,00:19:25.110
Well there's possibly,00:19:25.420,00:19:27.400
always room for,00:19:27.580,00:19:28.900
"improvement,",00:19:29.470,00:19:30.250
"I think,",00:19:30.700,00:19:31.180
just generally speaking there's few,00:19:31.750,00:19:33.339
areas in the world who,00:19:33.760,00:19:35.510
do get that 100,00:19:35.720,00:19:37.690
percent right.,00:19:37.700,00:19:38.740
And the key is just to keep,00:19:39.070,00:19:40.869
an open dialogue.,00:19:41.110,00:19:42.610
And I find that certainly,00:19:42.640,00:19:44.950
industry organizations like the EDIA,00:19:45.160,00:19:47.010
"and the PCA,",00:19:47.650,00:19:49.030
"Institute of Architects,",00:19:49.270,00:19:50.410
Planners etc. I don't know,00:19:50.440,00:19:52.240
"over east (Australia), but certainly
in W.A. are quite",00:19:52.920,00:19:54.730
a strong voice,00:19:55.210,00:19:56.190
"and it's a very closely,",00:19:56.530,00:19:58.330
"well-connected community,",00:19:58.430,00:20:00.099
with quite a bit of overlap,00:20:00.790,00:20:02.170
between the different industry,00:20:02.620,00:20:04.630
organisations,00:20:05.140,00:20:06.130
and their members.,00:20:06.460,00:20:07.370
And I think the foundation is really,00:20:07.690,00:20:09.399
"very, very good in W.A.",00:20:09.640,00:20:11.290
What I do feel,00:20:11.710,00:20:13.660
"and again,",00:20:13.870,00:20:14.590
that opinion is informed by,00:20:15.670,00:20:17.560
"my German background,",00:20:17.680,00:20:18.729
is that there's more opportunity for,00:20:19.300,00:20:21.280
industry and academia to come,00:20:22.060,00:20:23.679
together,00:20:23.950,00:20:24.550
and then inform,00:20:24.910,00:20:27.310
policies at a government level,00:20:27.430,00:20:29.350
and really have,00:20:29.830,00:20:31.600
the voice of the younger emerging,00:20:31.690,00:20:33.279
"generation heard,",00:20:33.790,00:20:34.419
especially the students,00:20:34.750,00:20:36.539
and foster that sense of,00:20:37.150,00:20:38.950
collaboration very early on.,00:20:39.430,00:20:41.710
Because you really need,00:20:42.040,00:20:43.820
from day one as you enter,00:20:44.200,00:20:45.579
and you know academic institutions,00:20:45.880,00:20:47.499
"really need to foster that
collaboration",00:20:48.280,00:20:49.809
between the facilities,00:20:50.410,00:20:52.000
that they embody.,00:20:52.480,00:20:53.940
"So you know, have Engineering talk
to the",00:20:54.250,00:20:55.700
Architecture Faculty,00:20:56.260,00:20:56.820
and to the,00:20:57.880,00:20:59.360
"Computer Engineering,",00:20:59.950,00:21:00.450
Mechanical etc.,00:21:00.910,00:21:02.650
so that there is a holistic approach,00:21:03.040,00:21:04.839
to the education.,00:21:05.230,00:21:06.280
"But then also make sure that
students get",00:21:06.580,00:21:08.680
"exposure to industry from day one,",00:21:08.800,00:21:10.459
so they don't leave as graduates,00:21:10.760,00:21:12.259
who are a little bit,00:21:12.820,00:21:14.650
perhaps,00:21:14.660,00:21:15.230
surprised by the realities,00:21:16.610,00:21:18.350
of Smart,00:21:18.650,00:21:20.269
cities or the development,00:21:20.540,00:21:23.000
industry more broadly.,00:21:23.270,00:21:24.550
"Yes, so kind of giving them",00:21:25.520,00:21:27.020
exposure to that early on so,00:21:27.980,00:21:29.810
"then when they come out they're,",00:21:29.840,00:21:31.270
"for want of a better term,",00:21:32.300,00:21:33.169
more useful to an employer,00:21:33.410,00:21:35.720
straight away,00:21:35.730,00:21:36.590
and have a grasp of,00:21:36.980,00:21:38.749
reality rather than just a,00:21:38.900,00:21:39.990
purely academic kind,00:21:41.270,00:21:43.009
of approach to things.,00:21:43.330,00:21:45.110
That's right. And just to expand on,00:21:45.410,00:21:47.209
"that, it works the other way around",00:21:47.360,00:21:48.799
as well.,00:21:49.310,00:21:49.940
If industry was a bit less,00:21:50.310,00:21:52.370
concerned about IP,00:21:52.490,00:21:54.140
"and I know that this is perhaps a
very",00:21:54.230,00:21:55.819
"naive comment on my behalf,",00:21:56.090,00:21:57.860
but if we could actually engage,00:21:58.250,00:21:59.869
with academic institutions,00:22:00.380,00:22:02.660
through research,00:22:03.350,00:22:05.270
that would really be wonderful,00:22:05.690,00:22:07.550
I believe.,00:22:07.555,00:22:07.610
You get the student involved,00:22:10.420,00:22:11.780
"with your projects that you're
working on",00:22:11.810,00:22:13.670
and you can share that widely,00:22:14.080,00:22:16.520
and it's great for the student,00:22:17.060,00:22:18.400
but it's also great for that,00:22:18.430,00:22:20.030
industry organisation,00:22:20.600,00:22:21.019
or that company because they,00:22:21.760,00:22:23.870
"get the,",00:22:24.085,00:22:24.135
"I guess, IP from from",00:22:25.340,00:22:27.230
the students,00:22:27.380,00:22:28.220
and they can work on on,00:22:28.250,00:22:30.030
problems or challenges that they,00:22:30.080,00:22:31.879
are facing in that moment.,00:22:32.240,00:22:33.890
But it's just say a resource,00:22:34.250,00:22:35.579
that is not,00:22:36.320,00:22:37.759
used very widely if at all.,00:22:38.180,00:22:40.070
Yeah I agree.,00:22:40.550,00:22:41.720
"I've seen a little bit of it
emerging",00:22:41.840,00:22:43.609
lately with this technology.,00:22:44.150,00:22:46.460
Particularly,00:22:47.390,00:22:47.440
in for example self-driving,00:22:49.220,00:22:50.410
cars or connected,00:22:51.050,00:22:52.730
vehicle technology.,00:22:53.870,00:22:55.070
Using PHD,00:22:56.210,00:22:57.690
or even you know Masters students,00:22:57.770,00:22:58.999
"or whatever, to kind of build
projects",00:22:59.480,00:23:00.859
that then industry can--,00:23:01.580,00:23:03.590
"You know, they get a very",00:23:03.710,00:23:05.060
"economical resource,",00:23:05.750,00:23:08.160
"for want of a better word,",00:23:08.390,00:23:09.370
a free resource to kind,00:23:09.380,00:23:10.909
of really dive deep into,00:23:11.210,00:23:13.460
"something that they're really
interested in",00:23:13.490,00:23:15.530
and then at the end they come out,00:23:15.830,00:23:17.299
with a product which then they can,00:23:17.450,00:23:19.249
sell to the government,00:23:19.640,00:23:21.710
or other industries.,00:23:21.770,00:23:23.100
So yeah I definitely think we'll see,00:23:23.130,00:23:24.769
"more of that and I think it's a
really",00:23:25.010,00:23:26.600
"good way of thinking about things
because",00:23:26.930,00:23:29.300
it's kind of a win-win -win,00:23:29.420,00:23:30.610
"for industry,",00:23:31.640,00:23:31.939
government and academia.,00:23:32.510,00:23:34.130
"So I think,",00:23:34.220,00:23:35.060
"I would really like to see more of
that",00:23:35.480,00:23:37.069
and I think through the Smart City,00:23:37.250,00:23:38.824
approach we will see more of that.,00:23:39.080,00:23:40.650
Yeah because ultimately the word,00:23:41.240,00:23:43.130
Smart implies that you are,00:23:43.140,00:23:44.780
strategic in,00:23:44.990,00:23:46.220
"your approach, whatever it may
relate",00:23:47.510,00:23:49.194
"to. So,",00:23:49.390,00:23:50.270
to not make use of that resource is,00:23:50.360,00:23:51.970
not very Smart.,00:23:53.500,00:23:54.730
But yeah I mean I,00:23:55.780,00:23:57.569
"think there are certain government
agencies that do it",00:23:57.890,00:23:59.860
quite well. And one reason,00:24:00.050,00:24:01.790
"why I love the White Gum Valley
Project",00:24:01.940,00:24:03.460
"so much is that it actually,",00:24:03.800,00:24:05.660
"you know-- Yes,",00:24:05.780,00:24:06.530
it's fairly small in scale,00:24:07.530,00:24:09.080
"but high impact because it involves
so",00:24:09.110,00:24:11.050
many different parties.,00:24:11.060,00:24:11.869
"Including obviously Curtin
University who",00:24:12.350,00:24:14.670
has made available a number of,00:24:15.170,00:24:16.939
really great researches,00:24:17.030,00:24:18.470
and a number of PHD,00:24:18.500,00:24:19.980
students,00:24:20.515,00:24:20.960
"and that information,",00:24:21.330,00:24:23.410
"like you say, will flow back to",00:24:23.420,00:24:25.550
"the government agency that are
developing",00:24:26.000,00:24:28.340
the project.,00:24:28.405,00:24:28.460
Yeah.,00:24:28.980,00:24:29.030
"I know you mentioned before about
Western",00:24:29.870,00:24:31.682
Australia/Australia being,00:24:32.945,00:24:35.110
leaders in some areas of Smart,00:24:35.120,00:24:36.799
City.,00:24:37.160,00:24:37.210
"Do you think that we can kind of,",00:24:38.630,00:24:40.365
"or we already are leaders in some
areas?",00:24:41.330,00:24:43.580
"I mean there's always areas of
improvement obviously,",00:24:44.720,00:24:47.210
"but can you,",00:24:47.240,00:24:47.380
"with your background from Europe,",00:24:49.670,00:24:51.418
can you see Australia where we're,00:24:51.565,00:24:53.700
the peaks and troughs of Smart city,00:24:54.530,00:24:56.660
and whether we can improve those,00:24:56.810,00:24:58.339
areas,00:24:58.640,00:24:59.390
or learn from others,00:24:59.580,00:25:00.980
or teach others.,00:25:01.010,00:25:02.240
What are your thoughts about that?,00:25:02.870,00:25:04.790
"Think I asked you 4 questions in
one,",00:25:05.100,00:25:06.720
just then.,00:25:07.705,00:25:07.755
Yeah look I think that,00:25:08.240,00:25:10.110
Australia is well placed for,00:25:10.145,00:25:11.919
a number of different reasons.,00:25:12.290,00:25:13.517
One being that we don't have the,00:25:13.940,00:25:15.649
legacy that is the urban,00:25:15.770,00:25:17.470
fabric like Europe has.,00:25:17.855,00:25:19.640
"And by that I mean we are not
constrained",00:25:20.300,00:25:21.949
by too much heritage,00:25:22.610,00:25:24.290
in terms of our buildings,00:25:24.590,00:25:25.985
and,00:25:25.941,00:25:25.990
the boundaries of our cities.,00:25:29.185,00:25:30.960
So I think that whilst,00:25:31.540,00:25:32.970
this can be a blessing,00:25:33.430,00:25:34.579
"and a curse, in this context,",00:25:35.000,00:25:36.290
perhaps it is a bit of a blessing,00:25:36.320,00:25:38.040
in that we can find,00:25:38.540,00:25:40.610
new ways and different ways,00:25:41.180,00:25:43.190
that would not ever work in,00:25:43.550,00:25:45.260
Europe.,00:25:45.860,00:25:46.400
And one example is that,00:25:46.580,00:25:48.500
the sheer scale of how we,00:25:48.950,00:25:51.090
grow as,00:25:51.425,00:25:53.060
a country,00:25:53.740,00:25:54.590
and development obviously follows,00:25:54.860,00:25:56.599
"that. And whilst I work in
greenfield",00:25:57.110,00:25:59.420
"development, I would at any",00:25:59.570,00:26:01.159
point promote infield,00:26:01.460,00:26:03.220
development and urban regeneration,00:26:03.440,00:26:05.340
over greenfield development.,00:26:05.460,00:26:06.340
Because,00:26:06.296,00:26:06.345
"that's a more sustainable way of
developing.",00:26:08.115,00:26:09.550
But when we do develop,00:26:10.900,00:26:12.289
at a large scale you know entire,00:26:12.770,00:26:14.690
new communities for 15- 20-,00:26:14.760,00:26:16.970
30 thousand people.,00:26:17.030,00:26:18.380
"That scale you know,",00:26:18.680,00:26:19.610
that's just in,00:26:21.020,00:26:21.890
"my native country,",00:26:23.180,00:26:25.280
we wouldn't see that.,00:26:25.950,00:26:27.170
So you know there's a really good,00:26:27.470,00:26:29.119
opportunity to do things,00:26:29.300,00:26:31.300
right and,00:26:31.315,00:26:31.830
work,00:26:34.020,00:26:34.370
with the technologies as,00:26:34.970,00:26:36.190
they are available.,00:26:37.190,00:26:38.430
And Australians are so,00:26:38.810,00:26:40.430
ready to embrace technology,00:26:40.670,00:26:41.989
and gadgets.,00:26:42.650,00:26:43.580
And I think that as a collective,00:26:43.740,00:26:45.319
"we're really, once",00:26:45.920,00:26:46.970
we acknowledge that we can,00:26:47.960,00:26:49.669
be change makers through,00:26:49.880,00:26:51.280
our engagement,00:26:52.370,00:26:53.330
with technology.,00:26:53.360,00:26:54.870
And once we have,00:26:55.400,00:26:56.870
"more people on board I really think
we're",00:26:57.320,00:26:59.130
really well-placed,00:26:59.820,00:27:01.490
to lead in,00:27:02.140,00:27:03.720
some aspects of Smart Cities,00:27:03.980,00:27:05.620
Movement. Whether it's,00:27:06.085,00:27:07.160
energy or transport.,00:27:08.040,00:27:10.100
But I really think that the,00:27:10.880,00:27:12.860
fact that people so readily,00:27:13.100,00:27:14.389
and happily use technology,00:27:14.990,00:27:16.309
in this country is,00:27:17.000,00:27:18.890
a real bonus for us in,00:27:18.980,00:27:20.720
implementing strategies that,00:27:20.960,00:27:22.770
rely on technology being,00:27:22.790,00:27:24.950
used by the wider population.,00:27:25.220,00:27:26.170
Yeah cool no.,00:27:27.680,00:27:28.470
It's a really good point.,00:27:28.880,00:27:30.080
"I suppose,",00:27:30.110,00:27:30.705
I think in some aspects,00:27:31.460,00:27:32.650
"it may be that heritage,",00:27:34.340,00:27:36.320
"I mean we obviously have some
heritage",00:27:36.350,00:27:38.480
but not to the scale of,00:27:38.510,00:27:40.010
the buildings and,00:27:40.670,00:27:42.160
the boundaries,00:27:42.890,00:27:44.239
of Europe.,00:27:44.900,00:27:45.510
So it's a really interesting way,00:27:45.980,00:27:47.749
"to think about. I suppose that's the
architect in",00:27:47.900,00:27:49.574
you. But how we can,00:27:49.760,00:27:51.170
reinvigorate urban areas,00:27:51.950,00:27:53.720
as a more sustainable way of,00:27:54.020,00:27:55.610
"developing, that's really
interesting.",00:27:55.920,00:27:57.620
I agree.,00:27:58.360,00:27:58.575
Cool.,00:27:59.010,00:27:59.060
So there is a lot of talk about,00:28:00.130,00:28:01.699
emerging trends.,00:28:01.940,00:28:02.990
"You know, a lot of buzzwords around.",00:28:03.460,00:28:05.150
"What do you think the emerging
trends are",00:28:05.270,00:28:06.889
"that people aren't talking about at
the",00:28:07.100,00:28:08.869
"moment. Well,",00:28:08.960,00:28:10.070
I think one of the,00:28:10.250,00:28:11.990
"things that people talk too much
about are",00:28:12.440,00:28:14.070
"electric vehicles,",00:28:14.690,00:28:15.740
with all due respect to electric,00:28:16.510,00:28:18.650
"vehicles, but they won't solve",00:28:18.660,00:28:20.450
the issues that we have relating to,00:28:20.510,00:28:22.249
congestion and health,00:28:22.400,00:28:23.239
and poor planning.,00:28:23.630,00:28:24.890
So yeah,00:28:25.530,00:28:27.090
"I would like to see a much,",00:28:27.650,00:28:29.630
"much broader discussion about
transport",00:28:29.750,00:28:31.850
"and I know this is already
happening.",00:28:32.300,00:28:33.950
But I would like for,00:28:34.000,00:28:35.550
that conversation to,00:28:36.220,00:28:37.160
really focus on a holistic,00:28:38.060,00:28:39.859
approach as opposed to the one,00:28:40.310,00:28:41.989
"element,",00:28:42.200,00:28:42.770
namely the electric vehicles,00:28:43.250,00:28:45.650
as well.,00:28:46.250,00:28:46.690
There is a lot of opportunity,00:28:47.810,00:28:49.430
to reduce the extent,00:28:50.060,00:28:51.469
of road infrastructure,00:28:51.920,00:28:53.170
through integrated transit,00:28:53.785,00:28:55.160
and gaining more,00:28:55.370,00:28:57.140
"green space and public open space
for",00:28:57.410,00:28:59.119
the benefit of the public.,00:28:59.240,00:29:01.070
So I would like to really,00:29:01.220,00:29:03.080
"have that at the forefront of the
conversation,",00:29:03.290,00:29:05.630
"after all, not about technology",00:29:06.015,00:29:07.189
itself but it's about making,00:29:07.880,00:29:09.169
sure that the cities become,00:29:09.740,00:29:11.240
"more livable and that we can
accelerate",00:29:11.810,00:29:13.129
sustainable sustainability efforts.,00:29:13.700,00:29:15.620
And we also need to ensure,00:29:15.950,00:29:17.659
that whatever cities we plan,00:29:18.050,00:29:20.150
"we do that in a way that is
inclusive",00:29:20.450,00:29:22.130
and it's not only accessible,00:29:22.310,00:29:23.930
to those who embrace,00:29:24.140,00:29:25.610
technology.,00:29:26.210,00:29:26.930
So by that I mean if we end,00:29:27.140,00:29:28.909
up with cities that are great for,00:29:29.060,00:29:31.130
the tech nerds who will walk around,00:29:31.190,00:29:32.959
with their iPhone,00:29:33.320,00:29:34.240
"all the time, and are glued to the
screen",00:29:35.210,00:29:36.890
and have got 50 odd different,00:29:36.920,00:29:38.960
apps on their phone.,00:29:39.110,00:29:39.640
That's-- We run the risk,00:29:40.670,00:29:42.319
of losing people who,00:29:42.560,00:29:44.300
are not like that.,00:29:44.390,00:29:45.350
So we've got to be very very mindful,00:29:45.530,00:29:47.149
and also disciplined to not,00:29:47.600,00:29:49.190
exaggerate in how much technology,00:29:49.850,00:29:52.190
we implement into our cities.,00:29:52.220,00:29:54.170
What I would like to see is for,00:29:54.590,00:29:56.389
that technology to be largely,00:29:56.570,00:29:58.280
"invisible, to just works",00:29:58.460,00:29:59.890
in the underground,00:30:00.410,00:30:01.130
or somewhere where,00:30:02.360,00:30:03.620
it's not as obvious.,00:30:04.460,00:30:06.440
And I think if,00:30:06.560,00:30:07.665
there's an opportunity to,00:30:08.395,00:30:10.190
customize the experience,00:30:10.280,00:30:11.689
that the person has,00:30:12.560,00:30:13.870
"with the environment,",00:30:13.826,00:30:14.659
that where we really great.,00:30:15.380,00:30:16.550
"To give you an example,",00:30:16.730,00:30:17.930
in Amsterdam which is,00:30:18.050,00:30:19.910
probably one of the most amazing,00:30:20.120,00:30:21.799
places in terms of Smart Cities.,00:30:22.280,00:30:24.100
"For those who are maybe listening if
you haven't",00:30:25.640,00:30:27.409
"heard of it then look it up,",00:30:27.740,00:30:29.710
"they have a very,",00:30:29.720,00:30:30.349
very good Web site.,00:30:30.740,00:30:32.240
It's called Amsterdam Smart City.,00:30:32.780,00:30:34.420
It's a great platform,00:30:35.150,00:30:37.100
"which is open to everybody,",00:30:37.250,00:30:38.510
"residents, industry,",00:30:38.610,00:30:39.370
government. It's a public-private,00:30:39.680,00:30:41.110
partnership to really drive,00:30:41.810,00:30:43.850
Smart initiatives,00:30:43.860,00:30:44.810
and it's a really good,00:30:44.910,00:30:46.970
reminder of what you really want,00:30:47.240,00:30:49.039
to get to.,00:30:49.220,00:30:49.940
"That's, to me,",00:30:50.120,00:30:50.170
that is like a model.,00:30:51.770,00:30:52.840
"If we get that level of
participation",00:30:53.230,00:30:54.619
at all levels of society that,00:30:55.490,00:30:57.259
would be really wonderful.,00:30:57.410,00:30:58.710
But one of the things that they've,00:30:59.090,00:31:00.950
developed is an app that,00:31:01.190,00:31:03.200
"lets cyclists,",00:31:03.440,00:31:04.640
"and you know there are very many
cyclists",00:31:04.700,00:31:06.860
"in the Netherlands in general,",00:31:06.920,00:31:08.510
"but also in Amsterdam,",00:31:08.960,00:31:10.280
and it lets cyclists,00:31:10.310,00:31:12.320
switch on street lights,00:31:12.590,00:31:14.570
"along their bike path as they're
driving",00:31:14.810,00:31:17.240
"or as they're cycling past through
their",00:31:17.320,00:31:19.151
phone. So you know something,00:31:19.750,00:31:21.269
"like that,",00:31:21.650,00:31:22.170
I think is pretty cool.,00:31:22.730,00:31:23.720
And obviously it has the benefit,00:31:24.000,00:31:25.789
of not wasting more energy than it's,00:31:26.210,00:31:27.919
needed for one city,00:31:28.070,00:31:29.660
who runs the asset that is a street,00:31:30.165,00:31:31.934
light. But for the user it,00:31:32.210,00:31:34.180
also gives a really,00:31:34.190,00:31:35.990
great experience.,00:31:36.020,00:31:37.310
You know I'm a cyclist myself,00:31:37.660,00:31:39.050
and if I could do that,00:31:39.060,00:31:40.020
when I'm riding along after dark,00:31:41.480,00:31:43.580
it would be great.,00:31:43.585,00:31:44.300
Yeah definitely.,00:31:44.660,00:31:45.060
"That sort of thing,",00:31:46.340,00:31:47.390
"if we could have a bit more of that,",00:31:47.785,00:31:48.690
it'd be awesome.,00:31:48.646,00:31:49.442
"Yeah,",00:31:50.120,00:31:50.170
definitely. That's really cool.,00:31:50.930,00:31:52.710
"Well it's been great to talk to you
this afternoon.",00:31:53.130,00:31:55.400
"Definitely lots of things going
through my",00:31:56.060,00:31:57.679
mind now thinking about,00:31:57.920,00:31:59.180
merging architecture,00:32:00.710,00:32:01.759
and engineering,00:32:02.510,00:32:02.629
and the center,00:32:03.340,00:32:04.750
of it all being people.,00:32:05.595,00:32:06.980
So yes. My last question,00:32:07.040,00:32:08.659
is how can people connect,00:32:09.110,00:32:10.490
with you.,00:32:10.520,00:32:10.990
LinkedIn is probably the best way,00:32:11.640,00:32:13.760
to find me.,00:32:14.720,00:32:16.220
My name is Janine Betz. I,00:32:16.850,00:32:17.385
think there's only one.,00:32:19.700,00:32:20.790
And just send me a message,00:32:21.110,00:32:22.900
and hopefully,00:32:23.030,00:32:24.830
you hear this podcast,00:32:25.040,00:32:26.330
and maybe you want to comment,00:32:26.600,00:32:28.520
on it,00:32:28.760,00:32:29.700
and then hopefully Zoe,00:32:29.710,00:32:31.730
you will share those comments,00:32:31.830,00:32:33.440
with me.,00:32:33.530,00:32:33.830
Yeah definitely.,00:32:34.270,00:32:35.270
Yeah sure will.,00:32:36.440,00:32:37.210
I'll put all the links,00:32:37.520,00:32:39.089

People should be able to connect,00:32:41.510,00:32:42.650
