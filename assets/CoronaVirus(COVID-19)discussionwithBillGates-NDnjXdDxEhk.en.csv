"- Hi, everyone, welcome",00:00:06.580,00:00:07.650
"to the Khan Academy Daily
Homeroom, Sal Khan here.",00:00:07.650,00:00:11.720
"Thanks for joining us, we
have a pretty exciting show",00:00:11.720,00:00:15.110
I guess today.,00:00:15.110,00:00:16.280
"For those of you all that
this is the first time",00:00:16.280,00:00:17.930
"you're joining, the whole
idea is in this time",00:00:17.930,00:00:19.630
"of school closures, we at
Khan Academy, we're trying",00:00:19.630,00:00:23.020
"to make sure that you
have the resources needed",00:00:23.020,00:00:24.710
"to keep learning, that you know
how to use those resources,",00:00:24.710,00:00:28.250
"and, that we have ways to
stay connected in times",00:00:28.250,00:00:30.710
of these closures.,00:00:30.710,00:00:31.750
And that's why we're doing this webinars,00:00:31.750,00:00:33.240
and why we're doing these live streams.,00:00:33.240,00:00:35.300
"I do wanna highlight as I
always do in the seminar,",00:00:35.300,00:00:38.380
in these live streams.,00:00:38.380,00:00:39.990
"Khan Academy is a not
for profit with a mission",00:00:39.990,00:00:42.290
of providing a free world class education,00:00:42.290,00:00:44.060
for anyone anywhere.,00:00:44.060,00:00:45.250
And we we're running in a little bit,00:00:45.250,00:00:46.370
"of a deficit even before,
this whole crisis struck",00:00:46.370,00:00:49.300
"but now we're seeing our
traffic is three acts",00:00:49.300,00:00:51.690
"of what it normally is,",00:00:51.690,00:00:52.710
and so any support is super valuable.,00:00:52.710,00:00:55.760
"I wanna give a special thanks
to several corporations",00:00:55.760,00:00:58.640
"that have stepped up in the
last few weeks in record time,",00:00:58.640,00:01:01.530
"Bank of America followed by
AT&amp;T, google.org, and Novartis.",00:01:01.530,00:01:06.100
And many of you have also helped donate,00:01:06.100,00:01:09.240
to help close our gap.,00:01:09.240,00:01:11.350
"And with that, I wanna make sure we have",00:01:11.350,00:01:13.280
"as much time as possible
for our guest today,",00:01:13.280,00:01:15.200
"I'll introduce someone who is
known for many many things,",00:01:15.200,00:01:18.470
"including one of being one
of the longtime supporters",00:01:18.470,00:01:21.350
"of Khan Academy, we have
Bill Gates here today.",00:01:21.350,00:01:25.190
"And, I encourage everyone,
whether you're watching",00:01:25.190,00:01:28.120
"on YouTube, or Facebook
or any other platform,",00:01:28.120,00:01:31.530
"post questions on the message boards,",00:01:31.530,00:01:33.420
"we have team members who
will surface questions",00:01:33.420,00:01:35.360
and I can ask bill those questions over,00:01:35.360,00:01:37.060
the course of our conversation.,00:01:37.060,00:01:39.090
"So Bill, great to see
you, maybe a good place",00:01:39.090,00:01:42.190
"to start is, how is the situation
affecting you personally?",00:01:42.190,00:01:46.990
How's the social distancing?,00:01:46.990,00:01:48.070
"And where are you spending
most of your time?",00:01:48.070,00:01:50.303
"- Well, I think everyone's lives",00:01:51.630,00:01:53.990
are almost completely upended.,00:01:53.990,00:01:56.860
"The normal, things I do,
talking about Polio eradication,",00:01:56.860,00:02:01.860
"going into meetings at
the foundation, traveling",00:02:02.000,00:02:04.700
to meet with scientists.,00:02:04.700,00:02:06.250
"That's all gone, when I
wake up in the morning",00:02:06.250,00:02:08.710
and I think was this a nightmare?,00:02:08.710,00:02:10.550
"Are we really in this
almost different world?",00:02:10.550,00:02:14.830
"Where Coronavirus is the
top priority, we've got",00:02:14.830,00:02:19.220
to get this thing under control.,00:02:19.220,00:02:21.700
"I'm doing lots of online meetings,",00:02:21.700,00:02:23.430
I use Microsoft Teams for those things.,00:02:23.430,00:02:26.430
"I don't get to see many people
beyond my family in person.",00:02:26.430,00:02:31.430
"So it's a, huge adjustment
and yet there's so much",00:02:33.710,00:02:38.710
"to be done, It's like I'm not not busy.",00:02:39.660,00:02:42.913
"- And where are you
spending most of your time?",00:02:44.130,00:02:45.500
Is that around the virus work?,00:02:45.500,00:02:48.163
"- Yes, that's, the our foundation works",00:02:49.330,00:02:54.330
"on infectious diseases,
we are the biggest funder",00:02:54.810,00:02:57.330
"of vaccine work, we understand,
how to make vaccines",00:02:57.330,00:03:01.360
"in volume, we do the disease modeling.",00:03:01.360,00:03:03.760
"And so, the skills that we have,",00:03:03.760,00:03:07.150
"understanding private
sector, being able to work",00:03:07.150,00:03:09.590
"with governments, what
regulatory things should",00:03:09.590,00:03:12.640
"be maintained for safety, and which ones,",00:03:12.640,00:03:16.670
"because we've got to move so
fast, Should you go around?",00:03:16.670,00:03:20.873
"and talking to leaders,
talking to Tony Fauci,",00:03:23.020,00:03:25.940
"About Okay, how do we make
sure the public is seeing this",00:03:25.940,00:03:28.670
in the right way.,00:03:28.670,00:03:30.250
"We explain, why it takes
so long for a vaccine,",00:03:30.250,00:03:32.840
"which is such a key thing
to.. until we have that,",00:03:32.840,00:03:37.840
We can open up a bit but,00:03:38.030,00:03:39.630
we won't go back completely to normal.,00:03:39.630,00:03:42.270
"And so we're orchestrating,
all of our partners around,",00:03:42.270,00:03:47.270
"getting the testing right,
getting the drugs right,",00:03:47.800,00:03:51.863
"and getting a vaccine
which will will bring us",00:03:52.840,00:03:57.840
to the end of this.,00:03:57.950,00:03:59.970
"- Yeah, now we're gonna
talk more about that.",00:03:59.970,00:04:01.570
"And actually, the first
question I wanna surface",00:04:01.570,00:04:03.400
"is from Facebook, Abid Sheikh,",00:04:03.400,00:04:05.140
"and I think it's front
of mind for a lot of us.",00:04:05.140,00:04:08.540
"He writes Hello, since you predicted about",00:04:08.540,00:04:10.870
"a similar outbreak in the 2015, Ted Talk,",00:04:10.870,00:04:14.190
"how did you react to the news
about the Covid 19 pandemic?",00:04:14.190,00:04:17.730
And that he's referring to a famously for,00:04:17.730,00:04:19.630
"anyone who doesn't know,
Bill made a talk in 2015,",00:04:19.630,00:04:22.650
that essentially was very prescient,00:04:22.650,00:04:24.160
of the situation we're in now.,00:04:24.160,00:04:25.660
"- Yeah, and I wrote a New England Journal",00:04:26.950,00:04:29.080
"of Medicine article
that really went through",00:04:29.080,00:04:30.520
"the specific things, like
high speed diagnostics",00:04:30.520,00:04:34.580
"and vaccine platforms
that we needed to fund.",00:04:34.580,00:04:39.240
"This is certainly a case
where being able to say,",00:04:39.240,00:04:41.840
"I told you so is not at all gratifying,",00:04:41.840,00:04:43.970
"because this is a horrific
disaster and in my lifetime,",00:04:43.970,00:04:48.860
"whether it's health or
economics or just uncertainty",00:04:48.860,00:04:52.140
"for people, there's nothing like this.",00:04:52.140,00:04:55.290
"And the goal there, was to
get governments to step up,",00:04:55.290,00:05:00.290
"so that you could easily
make a new RNA vaccine",00:05:01.020,00:05:04.850
"or you'd have, the testing
capacity very, very rapidly.",00:05:04.850,00:05:09.850
"I'm sure that because
this is so widespread",00:05:10.600,00:05:14.090
"that next time we will have
made those investments,",00:05:14.090,00:05:18.020
"but it's unfortunate that,
very little got done in",00:05:18.020,00:05:22.920
"our foundation, Wellcome Trust,",00:05:22.920,00:05:24.910
"a few others did fund
work along these lines,",00:05:24.910,00:05:28.950
but not enough.,00:05:28.950,00:05:30.513
"And, you know, so here, here we are.",00:05:31.700,00:05:33.823
"- And give us a sense of
where we are right now.",00:05:35.030,00:05:38.520
And we could talk a little bit about maybe,00:05:38.520,00:05:39.870
"what could or should have
happened, but where are we now?",00:05:39.870,00:05:42.550
"What's your analysis,
how bad is the situation",00:05:42.550,00:05:45.120
"in the US rest of world,
how close are we to peak?",00:05:45.120,00:05:47.880
"How's it's gonna play out over
the next few weeks or months?",00:05:47.880,00:05:50.843
"- Yeah so, the concept
of exponential growth,",00:05:51.890,00:05:55.760
"is not that intuitive to people,",00:05:55.760,00:05:58.000
but when you have this human,00:05:58.000,00:06:00.470
"to human transmissible respiratory virus,",00:06:00.470,00:06:03.800
"it creates exponential growth,
that is each case leads",00:06:03.800,00:06:07.190
"to, say two or more cases,
and so, if we haven't changed",00:06:07.190,00:06:12.190
"our behavior, there's no doubt
the majority of people would",00:06:14.070,00:06:18.980
"be infected, and you'd
get this huge overload",00:06:18.980,00:06:21.420
"of the medical system, and
literally millions of deaths.",00:06:21.420,00:06:26.420
"The reactions, whenever
you're gonna stop something",00:06:27.980,00:06:30.560
"that's exponential, the sooner you act,",00:06:30.560,00:06:33.220
"the better because then
you can act in a way that",00:06:33.220,00:06:35.690
you don't overload your hospital systems.,00:06:35.690,00:06:39.210
"And you can treat the
cases very, very well.",00:06:39.210,00:06:42.030
"Testing is key to know where's the spread,",00:06:42.030,00:06:44.860
and to inform people that they need,00:06:44.860,00:06:48.950
"to really isolate themselves, the tests",00:06:48.950,00:06:51.270
"the PCR test can actually
see the virus before",00:06:51.270,00:06:54.160
"you're symptomatic, before you would",00:06:54.160,00:06:55.540
be transmitting to people.,00:06:55.540,00:06:57.030
"And so, if we had had the
testing right prioritized,",00:06:57.030,00:07:00.970
"that would help with this,
with the social isolation,",00:07:00.970,00:07:05.373
"by the end of the month
with any luck, we'll start",00:07:06.470,00:07:09.350
to see the curve level off.,00:07:09.350,00:07:12.640
"And then another month, the
number of cases would come down.",00:07:12.640,00:07:16.700
"And you could get to a point where,",00:07:16.700,00:07:19.200
because you are targeting the testing,00:07:19.200,00:07:22.030
"and giving quick results,
that will do start",00:07:22.030,00:07:25.260
"to open up in a way like
China has where kids do go",00:07:25.260,00:07:29.870
"to school, people go back to their jobs,",00:07:29.870,00:07:32.180
"it's not normal that they
don't do sports events",00:07:32.180,00:07:36.020
"or big gatherings, that
will wait until the vaccine",00:07:36.020,00:07:40.120
"but we'd like, if things go well,",00:07:40.120,00:07:43.410
"and the numbers will
drive it. we'd like to see",00:07:43.410,00:07:45.800
"thatability to open up somewhat
by ideally early summer.",00:07:45.800,00:07:50.800
- And as we are all seeing evidence,00:07:51.450,00:07:52.670
that the social distancing is working that,00:07:52.670,00:07:54.170
"we are on track to peak,
in the next few weeks",00:07:54.170,00:07:56.950
"and then, get to maybe a more
a better state by the end",00:07:56.950,00:08:01.550
"of, I guess would be by the end of May.",00:08:01.550,00:08:04.110
"- Well, China had in Hebei
Province, over 80,000 cases",00:08:04.110,00:08:08.113
"and so that's the model
where they intervened",00:08:09.870,00:08:12.850
"in a very dramatic way,",00:08:12.850,00:08:14.950
"they enforced their
quarantine very strongly.",00:08:14.950,00:08:17.800
"They did their contact
tracing, they used the testing,",00:08:17.800,00:08:20.270
"people would get testing
results very quickly,",00:08:20.270,00:08:22.900
and it was the right people.,00:08:22.900,00:08:24.980
"They are now, able to open up.",00:08:24.980,00:08:28.370
"South Korea had reasonable
number of cases,",00:08:28.370,00:08:32.680
"but they did the testing did the tracing,",00:08:32.680,00:08:36.420
"and so now they are in
the situation where,",00:08:36.420,00:08:41.160
they've definitely bent the curve.,00:08:41.160,00:08:43.330
There are a few countries like Taiwan,00:08:43.330,00:08:45.160
"who did all the right
things and never allowed",00:08:45.160,00:08:48.260
the large numbers to develop.,00:08:48.260,00:08:49.700
"That unfortunately for most countries,",00:08:49.700,00:08:52.343
"we can't go back and
change the fact we missed",00:08:53.630,00:08:56.820
"that early opportunity, but
they, there are communities",00:08:56.820,00:09:01.190
"where we are starting
to see the numbers peak",00:09:01.190,00:09:04.610
"because of that social isolation,
so that's the first step",00:09:04.610,00:09:07.710
"is that peak, but you don't open up until",00:09:07.710,00:09:10.920
"they're in absolute, way below,",00:09:10.920,00:09:14.070
"like a factor of five
below where they are today.",00:09:14.070,00:09:16.713
"- Wow, and just from us, I
don't know from either economic",00:09:17.840,00:09:21.530
"or a scientific point of view,",00:09:21.530,00:09:23.310
"why do we see this disparity in testing,",00:09:23.310,00:09:25.760
or even the types of tests?,00:09:25.760,00:09:27.180
"In the US right now, even if
you're kind of lucky enough",00:09:27.180,00:09:30.240
"to get a test, so to speak, it
could still take several days",00:09:30.240,00:09:32.990
"to get a result, while
you know, I heard stories",00:09:32.990,00:09:35.240
"in Taiwan three months
ago, you get your results",00:09:35.240,00:09:37.810
before you leave the airport?,00:09:37.810,00:09:39.260
"- Yeah, the very sensitive test is",00:09:40.750,00:09:43.410
"the Polymerase Chain
Reaction PCR, where you make",00:09:43.410,00:09:47.540
the primer specifically for this virus.,00:09:47.540,00:09:51.360
It's an amazing test and there's a lot,00:09:51.360,00:09:53.480
"of machines out there, in
commercial labs, academic centers,",00:09:53.480,00:09:57.100
"public health labs, that we were slow",00:09:57.100,00:10:01.760
"to get them all going, even today,",00:10:01.760,00:10:03.950
"we're not completely
taken advantage of that.",00:10:03.950,00:10:07.090
"If you make sure you're
testing healthcare workers,",00:10:07.090,00:10:09.690
"you don't let the queue to get very long,",00:10:09.690,00:10:12.030
"you're testing contacts and
people who test positive,",00:10:12.030,00:10:15.760
that really is guiding individual behavior,00:10:15.760,00:10:18.240
and the abroad behavior.,00:10:18.240,00:10:19.910
"And so that in the US,
we actually have more",00:10:19.910,00:10:22.290
"of those machines per
capita than South Korea",00:10:22.290,00:10:24.990
or anyone else.,00:10:24.990,00:10:26.430
"So, it should be possible.",00:10:26.430,00:10:29.700
"There isn't a set of criteria
though, that stops somebody",00:10:29.700,00:10:33.380
"who's not symptomatic from
say, getting in the queue",00:10:33.380,00:10:36.540

is in some ways,",00:22:29.130,00:22:31.250

we are able to shut down,",00:22:31.250,00:22:33.830

back up in the fall?",00:22:36.870,00:22:40.270

trying to do the experiments",00:23:06.330,00:23:09.560

the worst case assumption.",00:23:37.610,00:23:41.040

us even if it's not seasonal,",00:23:41.040,00:23:45.440

yes, our vigilance will have",00:23:45.440,00:23:49.120

tiny bit in the summer,",00:23:49.120,00:23:51.700

less than we spend say",00:29:27.300,00:29:30.130

it, as a defining thing and,",00:29:57.530,00:30:02.530

we can, as I've talked about",00:30:37.810,00:30:40.280

about whether it's the pandemic,",00:30:40.280,00:30:44.100

experience for all of humanity,",00:30:56.620,00:30:59.870

"that we can stay
connected, I think the more",00:31:02.450,00:31:04.480
it will help all of us get through this.,00:31:04.480,00:31:06.020
