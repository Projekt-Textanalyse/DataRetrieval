"Hey everybody, it's Stephen from Asian Boss.
With the whole world on standstill right now,",00:00:00.000,00:00:04.960
"the only solution we seem to have to
flatten the curve on COVID-19 is social distancing,",00:00:05.160,00:00:10.180
"but what we desperately need
is a vaccine.",00:00:10.420,00:00:12.740
The problem is no one really seems to know how long,00:00:12.960,00:00:15.440
it's going to take to develop a vaccine for COVID-19.,00:00:15.480,00:00:18.240
"As a matter of fact, the whole process
of developing one",00:00:18.540,00:00:21.560
"remains such a mystery to so many people,",00:00:21.560,00:00:23.920
"so today we're here
at the International Vaccine Institute",00:00:24.100,00:00:26.620
"located in Seoul, South Korea to talk
with Director-General Dr. Jerome Kim.",00:00:26.660,00:00:31.280
"For today's interview, we've asked people
to submit their questions on Mogao,",00:00:31.500,00:00:34.940
"which is our own community app you can
download in the description.",00:00:35.120,00:00:38.000
"Dr. Kim is waiting for us as we speak,
so let's go have your questions answered",00:00:38.220,00:00:41.980
by this leading vaccine expert.,00:00:41.980,00:00:43.820
"Thank you so much
for sitting down with us today.",00:00:44.920,00:00:46.760
My pleasure.,00:00:46.760,00:00:47.640
"I'm sure you hear what's going on
on the news.",00:00:47.700,00:00:49.940
Pretty much the entire world is under lockdown.,00:00:50.140,00:00:52.920
"This whole question of developing a vaccine 
is on a lot of people's minds.",00:00:53.060,00:00:56.640
"Could you just maybe tell us 
a little bit about your background",00:00:56.780,00:01:00.000
and what you're currently doing.,00:01:00.060,00:01:01.460
"I trained as a medical doctor,",00:01:01.540,00:01:03.580
"specializing in internal medicine. 
and infectious diseases.",00:01:03.580,00:01:07.300
"After completing my training at Duke,",00:01:07.440,00:01:09.500
"I joined this program 
at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research.",00:01:09.560,00:01:13.460
"My first boss was a guy
named Robert Redfield,",00:01:13.460,00:01:15.700
"who's now the head of the US CDC,",00:01:15.720,00:01:18.560
"and under him was a woman
named Deborah Birx,",00:01:19.080,00:01:22.600
who is now the White House coordinator,00:01:22.860,00:01:26.060
for the pandemic response to COVID-19.,00:01:26.220,00:01:28.220
"And when I became eligible to retire, 
this job came up,",00:01:28.220,00:01:31.440
"and I thought, ""Hey, this would be 
a really kind of interesting",00:01:31.440,00:01:34.440
to work on things other than HIV.,00:01:34.440,00:01:36.580
"Many of the vaccines we work on 
are not as well funded as HIV,",00:01:36.680,00:01:40.140
but they're equally important.,00:01:41.100,00:01:42.260
"And it was good training I think 
for all of us at IVI.",00:01:42.260,00:01:47.200
"Then, working on a MERS vaccine
 became a priority for Korea,",00:01:47.200,00:01:50.180
"and now with COVID-19,
another coronavirus,",00:01:50.680,00:01:53.860
"we have the opportunity to work 
on another vaccine",00:01:53.860,00:01:56.300
"or set of vaccines that might
potentially protect against COVID-19 infection.",00:01:56.300,00:02:00.140
"So what is the International
Vaccine Institute?",00:02:00.260,00:02:04.100
How does it operate?,00:02:04.100,00:02:05.080
"IVI is an international organization
like the United Nations or WHO.",00:02:05.260,00:02:09.800
"We actually have member states,",00:02:09.920,00:02:11.500
"and a number of those member states 
actually provide funding to IVI.",00:02:11.500,00:02:15.140
"That would include the governments
 of Korea, India, Sweden,",00:02:15.240,00:02:18.020
"and soon we think,
the government of Finland.",00:02:18.060,00:02:20.600
"Our mission, which has been the same mission
 since 1997 when IVI was founded,",00:02:20.720,00:02:25.060
"was to discover, develop, and deliver safe, effective, 
and affordable vaccines for global health.",00:02:25.100,00:02:29.840
"Our focus is on diseases that start 
in developing countries",00:02:30.320,00:02:34.080
"for which no vaccine solution exists,",00:02:34.160,00:02:36.560
"developing a vaccine, 
getting it through testing,",00:02:36.700,00:02:39.760
"getting it approved, and getting it made in
sufficient quantities to be able to",00:02:39.760,00:02:44.620
"impact the disease 
that we're interested in.",00:02:44.760,00:02:46.800
"Did you guys anticipate 
anything like COVID-19 striking?",00:02:46.860,00:02:51.260
"SARS-CoV-1, 
the original SARS in 2002,",00:02:51.360,00:02:54.340
"was a much more severe disease 
and actually had a very high transmission rate.",00:02:54.360,00:02:58.760
"The nice thing about SARS-CoV-1, if there was anything that was going to be nice about an epidemic outbreak is",00:02:59.340,00:03:05.020
"that the people who were sick
were the people who transmitted,",00:03:05.340,00:03:08.920
"so if you put them in isolation, 
you could protect other people.",00:03:08.940,00:03:12.660
"The problem with the second SARS outbreak, 
the COVID-19 outbreak, is",00:03:12.700,00:03:16.380
"as you know, 
80% of people have minimal symptoms,",00:03:16.380,00:03:19.760
"and those people are 
the people who are going out",00:03:19.760,00:03:21.920
and spreading the disease to others.,00:03:21.960,00:03:24.000
"For a long time, those of us who do vaccines",00:03:24.000,00:03:26.880
"and are worried about outbreak diseases
have been saying that, you know,",00:03:26.880,00:03:31.180
"the World Bank estimated that we would spend, 
you know, six trillion dollars on outbreaks",00:03:32.240,00:03:36.900
"in the 21st century, and just this
outbreak probably takes us pretty close to that.",00:03:36.900,00:03:42.480
"I think that scientists have
known for a while that these coronaviruses",00:03:42.540,00:03:45.680
"like SARS, MERS, and COVID-19
actually jump back and forth",00:03:45.740,00:03:50.060
"- between humans and animals. 
- Yes.",00:03:50.060,00:03:51.780
The transmissibility issue was very important.,00:03:51.780,00:03:54.420
I mean it's as infectious as SARS.,00:03:54.420,00:03:56.300
It's 10 times more infectious than the flu.,00:03:56.300,00:03:58.620
"- It's also 10 times more deadly.
- Right.",00:03:58.900,00:04:01.400
"And that's what makes it 
a particularly potent combination of",00:04:01.400,00:04:05.260
"infectivity and virulence, and you know,",00:04:05.340,00:04:09.240
could there be another one?,00:04:09.250,00:04:10.440
"Possibly, but what when will it happen? 
I don't think anyone has the crystal ball on that.",00:04:10.440,00:04:14.760
"Unless you're in the field, I don't think",00:04:14.800,00:04:16.780
"people actually understand what is
a vaccine and why is it important.",00:04:16.860,00:04:22.580
"Disease protects against disease, so if
you got smallpox through variolation,",00:04:22.720,00:04:27.540
you were protected against smallpox.,00:04:27.540,00:04:29.080
So what a vaccine actually does,00:04:29.180,00:04:31.220
"- is it mimics the disease.
- I see.",00:04:31.360,00:04:33.480
"It takes a part of the virus or the bacteria,",00:04:33.480,00:04:36.660
"and you know, often we stick it under the skin,",00:04:36.800,00:04:39.720
"inject it into a muscle, or we give it orally,",00:04:39.720,00:04:42.220
but it trains your body's defensive system.,00:04:42.960,00:04:45.540
"So the body is defended by something 
called the immune system,",00:04:45.540,00:04:48.580
and the immune system,00:04:48.940,00:04:50.980
"in a way is like an army, like a defense force.",00:04:51.300,00:04:54.000
Right.,00:04:54.000,00:04:54.500
"And like every army,",00:04:54.500,00:04:55.660
it benefits from practice.,00:04:56.340,00:04:57.980
"And what you're doing 
when you're vaccinating is",00:04:58.160,00:05:00.460
"you introduce a small piece of the virus, 
a part of the bacterium, or a heat-killed germ,",00:05:00.460,00:05:07.920
"and the body sees it and says, 
""Oh, this isn't normal. This doesn't belong here.",00:05:08.760,00:05:12.280
"Let's attack it. Let's make sure
this doesn't cause a problem.""",00:05:12.380,00:05:15.180
And so the body puts together a response.,00:05:15.180,00:05:19.180
It makes proteins that fight infection.,00:05:19.400,00:05:21.960
"With a virus, these proteins 
may often neutralize the virus.",00:05:21.960,00:05:25.260
Right.,00:05:25.260,00:05:25.760
And those proteins are called antibodies.,00:05:25.840,00:05:27.880
"They're made by a particular 
kind of immune cell called a B cell.",00:05:28.200,00:05:31.460
"At the same time, 
the body's making what we call",00:05:31.700,00:05:34.760
"killer cells and helper cells,",00:05:34.760,00:05:37.120
and those fall under the T cell category.,00:05:37.120,00:05:40.100
"So as the body's making these cells,
 the killer T cells",00:05:40.280,00:05:43.660
"are able to attack cells that 
have been infected by the virus.",00:05:43.700,00:05:47.420
Or the helper cells...,00:05:48.220,00:05:49.920
"Basically, they're kind of like the source of information and communication in the immune system,",00:05:49.920,00:05:54.840
"so your helper cells tell
the B cells, ""Make antibodies.""",00:05:54.920,00:05:59.020
The helper cells help the killer cells,00:05:59.460,00:06:02.240
by giving them the right kinds of signals,00:06:02.240,00:06:04.640
"to go ahead and mount a full attack
against the virus.",00:06:04.640,00:06:08.060
"So they're all part of white blood cells? 
Is that correct?",00:06:08.060,00:06:10.740
They're all white blood cells. Right.,00:06:10.740,00:06:12.500
"White blood cells defend you 
against infection.",00:06:12.560,00:06:14.660
"They're not the only white blood cells,",00:06:14.660,00:06:16.080
"because there are some white
blood cells that aren't specific",00:06:16.080,00:06:19.860
"to particular pathogens, but they exist primarily 
to defend you generally against infection.",00:06:20.100,00:06:26.140
"They're like the fence
on the outside of a camp, whereas inside,",00:06:26.140,00:06:30.160
"you have the soldiers, the cells that
are trained specifically to fight",00:06:30.160,00:06:35.620
"against this virus or that bacterium, 
and it's to the point where, you know,",00:06:35.620,00:06:40.920
some of these cells will not react.,00:06:40.940,00:06:42.620
"So if you have a B cell that is specific
for smallpox or COVID-19,",00:06:42.620,00:06:49.240
"and you come in with, you know, 
a completely different virus,",00:06:49.420,00:06:52.860
like a virus for...,00:06:52.860,00:06:55.280
Rotavirus or respiratory syncytial virus,00:06:56.180,00:06:59.540
That B cell is going to say...,00:06:59.540,00:07:01.460
Nothing. Won't react.,00:07:02.300,00:07:03.440
"It really is highly specific 
for the pathogen",00:07:03.880,00:07:06.980
that induced it.,00:07:06.980,00:07:08.720
"And actually, that's a good thing, 
because you don't want your B cells, you know,",00:07:08.880,00:07:12.080
just cranking out antibodies.,00:07:12.160,00:07:13.640
"- And fighting everything there.
- Right. Yeah.",00:07:13.660,00:07:15.380
I mean what you want is something that is,00:07:15.380,00:07:17.379
really directed exactly at the pathogen.,00:07:17.379,00:07:20.240
"If we use the whole killed virus,",00:07:20.240,00:07:22.600
it would be the entire virus.,00:07:22.600,00:07:24.020
"You know, the outer coat, 
which has, you know, 3 or 4 proteins,",00:07:24.020,00:07:27.180
"and the inner coat, which has
usually a mixture of different proteins as well.",00:07:27.280,00:07:30.720
"Often with a vaccine, we can
actually focus the body's defensive response",00:07:32.140,00:07:35.920
"on the one or two things
that are the most important.",00:07:35.920,00:07:38.820
"And so, you know,",00:07:39.000,00:07:39.940
"unlike a natural infection where your
body's responding to everything in the virus,",00:07:39.940,00:07:43.960
"with a vaccine, 
we can actually tell the body,",00:07:44.080,00:07:46.360
"""You don't need to respond to everything.""",00:07:46.360,00:07:47.700
"""Respond to this, 
and that will kill it.""",00:07:47.700,00:07:50.060
"So in a way, that vaccine",00:07:50.060,00:07:51.880
"allows the body to be smart 
about what to attack.",00:07:52.420,00:07:55.460
And you can control that dosage?,00:07:55.900,00:07:57.940
"Actually you can control it by
how much of the vaccine you give.",00:07:58.300,00:08:02.660
"In fact, one of the things you do 
when you're testing is you increase the dose",00:08:02.700,00:08:07.320
"to see what the best dose 
is that induces the best response.",00:08:08.040,00:08:11.160
"Sometimes you want the response 
to occur after the first dose.",00:08:11.160,00:08:14.120
"You may give slightly more,",00:08:14.120,00:08:15.300
and we know this for several vaccines.,00:08:15.300,00:08:17.300
"You have to space out
the doses in order to get the maximal response",00:08:17.300,00:08:20.760
and a response that will last a long time.,00:08:20.760,00:08:22.640
"So when you're developing a vaccine,
sometimes you're interested in",00:08:22.640,00:08:26.540
"a lot upfront, very quickly after the first dose.",00:08:26.540,00:08:29.360
"Sometimes, you're waiting for the immune system",00:08:29.360,00:08:32.240
"to get to be appropriately
reminded, so you give one dose,",00:08:32.240,00:08:35.580
"and then you give a booster dose, 
and then you give another dose.",00:08:35.580,00:08:38.240
"And that actually allows 
the defensive response to become better.",00:08:38.540,00:08:42.200
"The more times your body's immune system 
is exposed to a pathogen, to a germ,",00:08:42.580,00:08:48.460
"the better and faster and bigger 
the responses get.",00:08:49.160,00:08:52.280
"So when a child gets 3 vaccines,",00:08:52.900,00:08:55.820
"every time they get a booster, 
the response goes higher",00:08:55.820,00:08:59.880
"and comes up faster and is much
more specific.",00:08:59.960,00:09:03.860
This is just the way the body has,00:09:03.860,00:09:06.120
"adapted to living in a world
full of germs.",00:09:06.580,00:09:09.420
"We're lucky that we have 
this specific immune response.",00:09:09.420,00:09:12.860
We call it the adaptive immune response.,00:09:12.860,00:09:14.720
"Why does a vaccine take 
so long to develop?",00:09:15.060,00:09:19.020
"So right, under normal circumstances",00:09:19.020,00:09:21.860
"with a standard pathogen that we're interested 
in developing a vaccine against,",00:09:21.980,00:09:26.540
"it could take 5 to 10 years, 
and that's pretty standard.",00:09:26.560,00:09:29.760
"If you look at the vaccines,
sometimes there are 4 sometimes 6",00:09:29.880,00:09:33.620
and sometimes 10 or more.,00:09:33.620,00:09:35.200
"I mean, we've been working 
on HIV vaccine without one.",00:09:35.200,00:09:38.140
"So why do we not have an HIV
vaccine if so many smart people have",00:09:38.680,00:09:43.900
been working on this for a decade.,00:09:43.900,00:09:46.180
That actually is the million-dollar question.,00:09:46.180,00:09:48.600
"And this gets to why we think 
also that a COVID-19 vaccine",00:09:48.600,00:09:52.700
may be more possible.,00:09:52.700,00:09:54.200
"Remember I was talking about how 
after you've gotten an infection,",00:09:54.300,00:09:57.300
you're protected.,00:09:57.380,00:09:58.120
"That's because, you know... 
So say you develop COVID-19.",00:09:58.200,00:10:01.560
"You acquire COVID-19 from, you know,
somebody who's coughing.",00:10:01.560,00:10:05.480
"As your body is mounting that response, it's making 
the infection-fighting proteins called antibodies.",00:10:05.620,00:10:10.140
"It's developing the killer cells, 
and that combination of antibody",00:10:10.240,00:10:14.500
"and cells drives the virus out
of the body. It gets rid of it.",00:10:14.500,00:10:18.520
The second part of it is that who's protecting the body? Why is the body immune to a second infection?,00:10:18.520,00:10:23.280
"Well, it's because these infection-fighting proteins 
and killer cells are there,",00:10:23.280,00:10:27.260
"and they're ready, and they're waiting, 
and if they ever see COVID-19 again,",00:10:27.260,00:10:30.520
"they immediately, you know,
significantly increase the number of",00:10:30.520,00:10:35.140
"antibodies and cells, 
and they keep the virus at bay.",00:10:35.260,00:10:39.280
"So knowing that, makes it",00:10:39.280,00:10:42.220
"much more likely that 
we can develop a vaccine.",00:10:42.230,00:10:44.680
The problem with HIV is that it,00:10:44.680,00:10:47.120
"doesn't behave that way. With HIV, you can
be infected with HIV, but you can be",00:10:47.120,00:10:52.130
"infected again, so we know that you can
be, we say, superinfected. So if you are",00:10:52.130,00:10:56.870
"completely controlled on drugs... Right, so
with HIV we can treat people and",00:10:56.870,00:11:00.830
"eliminate the virus to undetectable. If
you happen to have sex with someone who",00:11:00.830,00:11:05.630
"has a resistant virus,
you can acquire that resistant virus, and",00:11:05.630,00:11:09.490
"it could it could take over. So superinfection, as we call it, the lack of",00:11:09.490,00:11:14.860
"protective durable immune responses in
an HIV-infected person is one of the",00:11:14.860,00:11:19.810
"reasons it's so difficult to develop a
vaccine. One of the T cells helps",00:11:19.810,00:11:23.710
everything. It's like the controlling... the communications center,00:11:23.710,00:11:27.670
"for the immune system. HIV attacks that
cell and kills it. That is the target",00:11:27.670,00:11:32.920
"cell for HIV, so now all of a sudden, your
immune system is without an effective",00:11:32.920,00:11:38.050
"way to communicate to the B cells and to
the killer cells. The other thing is that",00:11:38.050,00:11:42.010
"the virus, the HIV virus itself, has
involved a whole series of protective",00:11:42.010,00:11:46.450
"mechanisms. It mutates itself very very
frequently, so it changes the proteins on",00:11:46.450,00:11:51.280
"the surface. So in an HIV infected person,
you can have billions of slightly",00:11:51.280,00:11:56.290
different viruses in your blood.,00:11:56.290,00:11:57.940
Wow.,00:11:57.940,00:11:58.600
"I mean my lab, when I was still in",00:11:58.600,00:12:00.460
"the Army, used to sequence these viruses,
and you know, we could sequence a",00:12:00.460,00:12:03.760
"thousand very easily, and they're all
different.",00:12:03.760,00:12:06.920
COVID-19 is not like that?,00:12:07.100,00:12:08.440
So we think... It's still one of the unanswered,00:12:09.240,00:12:11.340
"questions, but the belief is... And you
see this manifested actually now in",00:12:11.340,00:12:15.660
"everyone's belief that if they expose
themselves to COVID-19, they might become",00:12:15.670,00:12:19.030
"immune, and therefore they can go to work.
We think that COVID-19 infection is",00:12:19.030,00:12:26.770
"protective against future infection. 
So it gives you immunity against",00:12:26.770,00:12:30.580
reinfection.,00:12:30.580,00:12:31.520
"That's what we heard as well
from Dr. Fauci as well as Professor Woo-Joo Kim.",00:12:31.520,00:12:36.400
"So far, they had a lot of reactivated
cases or relapses, but they haven't seen",00:12:36.600,00:12:42.340
any case of reinfection.,00:12:42.340,00:12:44.160
"- Right. 
- Is that correct?",00:12:44.160,00:12:45.740
So the problem is that it's,00:12:45.740,00:12:46.810
"difficult to tell. One of them is I think
that the tests are not sensitive enough,",00:12:46.810,00:12:51.360
"so you know, you're recovering
from the virus infection, and the amount",00:12:51.370,00:12:58.000
"of virus in your blood is decreasing, and
the amount of virus in your throat, the",00:12:58.000,00:13:01.210
"places that they're swabbing, is
decreasing. And finally you reach a level",00:13:01.210,00:13:06.040
"of virus where the test can no longer
pick it up, but it's still there.",00:13:06.040,00:13:10.360
"We heard that that's around below 3,000 viruses.",00:13:10.360,00:13:14.160
It's actually... I'm not sure,00:13:14.160,00:13:15.430
"that we know the count, especially
on the throat, where that level of",00:13:15.430,00:13:20.350
"sensitivity
is, but with HIV for instance, you know,",00:13:20.350,00:13:23.209
"we first started measuring the virus in
the blood, and the lowest we could go is a",00:13:23.209,00:13:27.019
"thousand per cc of blood, and then it was
400, and now it's 50, and it's going below",00:13:27.019,00:13:33.499
"that soon. So if you were negative at
a thousand, it didn't mean that you were",00:13:33.499,00:13:37.369
"negative. It just meant you were below
the level of detection, so one of the",00:13:37.369,00:13:41.509
"potential explanations is, you know, these
kits were rushed out. I mean, they are",00:13:41.509,00:13:44.959
"really good kits. I mean, the
sensitivity and specificity of the kits is",00:13:44.959,00:13:48.439
"really remarkable, considering how
quickly they were made and tested and",00:13:48.439,00:13:52.429
"you know, then reviewed
and then approved by the regulatory",00:13:52.429,00:13:56.600
"authorities. The second part is could it
be reactivation? So I think increasingly",00:13:56.600,00:14:00.949
"in the last 2 weeks, we've been
learning that COVID-19 doesn't only",00:14:00.949,00:14:04.609
"attack the lungs, it attacks the kidneys, it can attack the brain, it attacks",00:14:04.609,00:14:08.419
the heart.,00:14:08.419,00:14:09.060
"- Inflammation 
- Inflammation. Right, and could the virus be present",00:14:09.060,00:14:13.579
"in those sites even after we can no
longer detect it with the nasal swabs?",00:14:13.579,00:14:18.199
"And that's possible too, and I think
that's the reservoirs, the re-emergence",00:14:18.199,00:14:23.959
"of disease, and then there's the
possibility of reinfection, and I think,",00:14:23.959,00:14:28.040
"you know, we all think that
that's the least likely because",00:14:28.040,00:14:32.059
"what you should see is that if a person
is ""reinfected,"" the person who",00:14:32.059,00:14:35.839
"infected or reinfected him should be
transmitting to others, and we're not",00:14:35.839,00:14:39.829
"seeing those clusters being reported, so
that makes it somewhat less likely, but",00:14:39.829,00:14:44.059
"again this is something that really has
to be understood better.",00:14:44.060,00:14:47.220
How much would you say it costs to develop a vaccine in general?,00:14:47.220,00:14:51.080
"Usually, if you asked GSK (GlaxoSmithKline) or",00:14:51.080,00:14:53.480
"Merck, they would tell you 500 million
for an easy vaccine. 1 billion to 2",00:14:53.480,00:15:00.169
"billion for a difficult vaccine. And in part,
that's related to the 5 to 10 year time",00:15:00.169,00:15:05.779
"frame. Right? So you start in the
laboratory. You develop something you",00:15:05.779,00:15:10.220
"think might be a vaccine. You might
actually develop, you know, several of",00:15:10.220,00:15:13.009
"them, and then you test them in animals,
and again, that takes time, right? Because",00:15:13.009,00:15:16.669
"you have to make the vaccine. Then you
have to test it. You are experimenting to",00:15:16.669,00:15:21.379
"see if you're at the right dose, and
you're checking the animal to make sure",00:15:21.379,00:15:25.100
"it doesn't get sick from receiving the
vaccine. All that can take years, because",00:15:25.100,00:15:31.039
"you're optimizing it in the laboratory.
And then it's transition",00:15:31.039,00:15:34.380
"to the point where we manufacture
it in a particular way with very high",00:15:34.380,00:15:39.090
"attention to quality, because then it
jumps from being in animals, being tested",00:15:39.090,00:15:43.650
"in, you know, mice and rabbits to being
tested in humans. And the level of",00:15:43.650,00:15:48.630
"quality that's necessary in order for it
to be tested in humans is very different.",00:15:48.630,00:15:52.220
"The initial tests in humans is what we call
Phase 1.",00:15:52.860,00:15:56.160
How many phases are there?,00:15:56.420,00:15:57.360
"There are 3 phases. Well actually,
there's a fourth phase also, but",00:15:57.360,00:16:00.420
"the testing, the true testing phases, are
1, 2, and 3. The first phase is really, we say,",00:16:00.420,00:16:05.400
"safety and immunogenicity. Safety is what
it sounds like. We don't know that this",00:16:05.400,00:16:09.810
"brand-new vaccine is safe, so we inject
it into people, usually not very quickly.",00:16:09.810,00:16:14.520
"I mean, we inject a number of people, then
wait. And then we increase the number or",00:16:14.520,00:16:18.750
"increase the dose or change the dosage.
Typically, less than 50 people are",00:16:18.750,00:16:23.040
"involved. It's really just
to make sure it's safe and to make sure",00:16:23.040,00:16:27.000
"that the vaccine generates at least a
hint of the right immune responses. Phase",00:16:27.000,00:16:32.460
"2 is actually much larger. You know, often
hundreds of volunteers. And in Phase 2,",00:16:32.460,00:16:38.250
"you're really looking to see does the
vaccine actually generate what we are",00:16:38.250,00:16:43.050
"hoping to see? The right antibodies, the
infection-fighting proteins, the right",00:16:43.050,00:16:47.910
"types of cells, the killer cells and the
helper cells, and often we're",00:16:47.910,00:16:52.200
"experimenting, you know, should we give
1 or 2 doses one month apart, or can we",00:16:52.200,00:16:56.430
"give one dose and then wait six months. 
And you're doing that, and you also",00:16:56.430,00:17:01.440
"then you're going to go into the target
population. So for one of our vaccines",00:17:01.440,00:17:06.180
"that's for children, we would be, we say,
age de-escalating, so we'd start in adults then",00:17:06.180,00:17:10.410
"move to teenagers and then into children. 
And so you really try to determine in",00:17:10.410,00:17:14.970
"the target population, does this work? And
so now you're involving hundreds of",00:17:14.970,00:17:18.000
"people, and you can see now the costs are
starting to build. At the same time, the",00:17:18.000,00:17:21.900
"company has to, you know, learn how to
make the vaccine, because it's not just",00:17:21.900,00:17:26.400
"taking a vaccine that that worked in a
test tube and that you could grow in a",00:17:26.400,00:17:29.910
"500 ml flask. I mean, now they're
thinking, ""Now we're going to have to put",00:17:29.910,00:17:35.010
"this in a thousand-liter reactor."" And so
how are we going to get from, you know,",00:17:35.010,00:17:39.990
"the thing that's on your tabletop to
something that's this giant stainless",00:17:39.990,00:17:43.590
steel Dewar thermos bottle that,00:17:43.590,00:17:46.620
"is growing millions or billions of cells
or virus particles per ml. Then you",00:17:46.620,00:17:52.620
"collect the data, right? So now, you have
hundreds of samples from these",00:17:52.620,00:17:55.649
"volunteers. You're analyzing the safety
data, which is all in computers. And then",00:17:55.649,00:17:59.700
"you're trying to decide, well, do I make a
decision to go for the, you know, to go",00:17:59.700,00:18:04.289
"for it. To test this vaccine to see if it
works, or are we going to go back a step and",00:18:04.289,00:18:09.749
"reformulate it or, you know, give it a
larger dose or, you know, increase the",00:18:09.749,00:18:13.769
"number of doses from 2 to 3. So all
of this is going on, you know, as the",00:18:13.769,00:18:18.269
"company is developing the vaccine, and
every time you're doing that, you're",00:18:18.269,00:18:22.049
adding costs.,00:18:22.049,00:18:22.929
"So what's the conversion
rate like? Do all the trials end up making",00:18:22.929,00:18:26.369
it to Phase 3? Or...,00:18:26.369,00:18:28.540
"No, and so 93% of
trials fail sometime between the animal",00:18:28.540,00:18:34.019
study and the final approval,00:18:34.019,00:18:37.720
"- of the vaccine for marketing.
- Right, right.",00:18:37.720,00:18:39.360
The number,00:18:39.360,00:18:40.259
"that fail is greatest in the
animal stage. The company just",00:18:40.259,00:18:43.769
"decides that this is not worth doing. And
then in Phase 1, there's further drop",00:18:43.769,00:18:47.639
"out because then the company says, ""Well
you know, this is tougher than we thought.""",00:18:47.639,00:18:50.039
"And then by Phase 2, the company is
really interested, and they're really",00:18:50.039,00:18:54.090
"looking at those responses in the target
populations. If you can't induce the",00:18:54.090,00:18:57.990
"right response, you're at the maximum
dose and, you know, you don't think that",00:18:57.990,00:19:01.440
"the pediatric schedule would tolerate,
you know, a fourth dose of the vaccine, then",00:19:01.440,00:19:05.580
"the companies will go, ""Well, do we really want to do this or is there something we",00:19:05.580,00:19:08.580
"can do to make it better?"" And then by the
time you get to Phase 3, you are",00:19:08.580,00:19:12.299
"pretty certain that the vaccine is going
to work, because a company doesn't want",00:19:12.299,00:19:15.899
"to invest in a trial that involves
thousands of people for a vaccine that",00:19:15.899,00:19:20.580
they're really not sure will work.,00:19:20.580,00:19:22.200
Because there has to be financial,00:19:22.200,00:19:23.369
incentive for them as well.,00:19:23.369,00:19:24.280
"Right. And so that's the, you know, the",00:19:24.280,00:19:26.519
"biggest cost but also the biggest gain
if you succeed in Phase 3, which",00:19:26.519,00:19:30.299
"looks at efficacy and safety, so it's
looking to see if the vaccine protects",00:19:30.299,00:19:35.129
"against infection or disease or both.
Because if you do, and you know that it's",00:19:35.129,00:19:39.179
"70% or 80% efficacious, then you
put together this entire pack of",00:19:39.179,00:19:46.889
"data. It's about a hundred thousand pages
in the old style, like several containers",00:19:46.889,00:19:51.899
"full of papers. You take it to the Food and
Drug Administration, and you say, ""This is",00:19:51.899,00:19:56.850
"our analysis of our data. We think the
vaccine works,",00:19:56.850,00:19:59.760
"and we would like for you to approve it.""
And after a year, the FDA decides, ""Okay, we",00:19:59.760,00:20:06.270
"agree. It works. It protects. It's ready.""
And they give you the, you know, the",00:20:06.270,00:20:11.400
"approval, but that doesn't mean that
people are going to use your vaccine.",00:20:11.400,00:20:14.310
"Then you often have to go to another
group, which in the United States,",00:20:14.310,00:20:18.600
"recommends vaccines. And it's similar. So
if you're working with WHO, there's a",00:20:18.600,00:20:24.030
"WHO group called SAGE, the Strategic
Advisory Group of Experts on",00:20:24.030,00:20:28.200
"Immunization. And SAGE recommends the
vaccine. Because you can imagine many",00:20:28.200,00:20:32.220
"countries don't have enough vaccine
experts to compose something like the",00:20:32.220,00:20:38.130
"SAGE, or like the ACIP in the United
States. And so they depend on the WHO's",00:20:38.130,00:20:43.950
"recommendation in order to
consider the vaccine before uptaken into",00:20:43.950,00:20:48.660
"their program. So now you have the
recommendation to use it, and you also",00:20:48.660,00:20:53.520
"now have to make sure that you have
enough vaccines. So typically, as a",00:20:53.520,00:20:56.760
"vaccine is entering Phase 3 the
companies are ramping up production.",00:20:56.760,00:21:00.390
"Because as soon as it's approved, they
want to be able to sell it and that's",00:21:00.390,00:21:04.590
"why the process at that point is so
efficient. And they want to make sure",00:21:04.590,00:21:07.320
"that they can manufacture it for as low
of price as possible",00:21:07.320,00:21:10.290
"because that again allows them to
maximize the benefit to the company. And",00:21:10.290,00:21:14.060
"that would be how it works under
normal circumstances and you can see, you know,",00:21:14.060,00:21:18.000
"Phase 3 might take two years
because it's, you know, several thousand",00:21:18.080,00:21:21.640
"people. Like, the trial that we did in
Thailand was 16,000 people.",00:21:21.640,00:21:25.600
Wow.,00:21:25.840,00:21:26.460
"The trial that the army did in Thailand
for hepatitis A vaccine was 40,000.",00:21:26.500,00:21:32.300
"So some of these trials are
very big and complex and and expensive.",00:21:32.600,00:21:36.820
"And then, you know, the company is
ready to sell it. For COVID-19,",00:21:37.680,00:21:43.800
"Dr. Fauci says 12 to 18 months to
the proof that the vaccine works. Because",00:21:43.800,00:21:48.880
"you can see now we're in Phase 1. By
the midsummer, the earliest starters",00:21:48.880,00:21:52.920
"will probably be considering moving into
Phase 2. And so Phase 1, at this point,",00:21:52.960,00:21:57.080
"won't even be over. They'll be looking at
the initial, ""Is it safe? Are we seeing",00:21:57.090,00:22:01.560
"responses?"" And if they are, then they'll
probably move into Phase 2, and Phase 2",00:22:01.560,00:22:06.540
"will have doses, different doses, or
different dosing schedules in the target",00:22:06.540,00:22:11.250
"population, and now you're thinking several
hundred people, or hundreds of people.",00:22:11.250,00:22:15.410
"And if things are looking good, and again,
you're not going for a population that's",00:22:15.410,00:22:20.220
"necessarily at high risk. Because you
want to make sure, again, that safety, that",00:22:20.220,00:22:24.900
"you're getting the right immune
responses before you take it forward to",00:22:24.900,00:22:27.450
"challenge, you know, in a population that
is at risk for infection. Final phase,",00:22:27.600,00:22:32.240
"Phase 3,
has to be done in a population that is",00:22:32.250,00:22:36.360
"at risk for the disease. Right.
Right, so you wouldn't necessarily, for",00:22:36.360,00:22:39.570
"instance, do an HIV vaccine in a
population that had zero risk for HIV.",00:22:39.570,00:22:43.230
"And so you'd have to find a part of the
world that had a significant... Has",00:22:43.230,00:22:47.070
"- significant problems with COVID-19 infection.
- So Korea is pretty under control.",00:22:47.070,00:22:50.860
"Right, and so it would be
difficult to do Phase 3 testing in Korea.",00:22:50.880,00:22:54.120
"So you'd have to look
somewhere else in the world that's",00:22:54.160,00:22:56.760
"having a major COVID-19 outbreak. 
So, somewhere in Europe or...",00:22:56.760,00:23:00.120
"- States? 
- and States or you know South America,",00:23:00.140,00:23:03.700
"and then, hopefully, 
at the end of 12 to 18 months,",00:23:03.700,00:23:07.340
"you know, the study... Actually, the study
could get stopped earlier if the vaccine",00:23:07.340,00:23:11.660
"is really really working well. Or it
could go all the way to its conclusion",00:23:11.670,00:23:15.750
"and we will need to look at what we call
the unblinding. So, typically, when you do",00:23:15.750,00:23:20.370
"a vaccine study, a certain group of
people gets vaccine, and another group",00:23:20.370,00:23:23.790
"gets placebo, which is an inactive
substance. And at some point, you have to",00:23:23.790,00:23:27.210
"be able to look and say, ""Yeah, the people who
got vaccine are protected, the people who have...",00:23:27.210,00:23:31.260
"Who didn't get vaccine have
infection at a certain rate, and this is...",00:23:31.280,00:23:35.660
"This means the vaccine protects."" And
hopefully, that will happen within the 18,",00:23:35.670,00:23:39.240
"- you know, 12 to 18 month window. 
- How optimistic are you about that timeline?",00:23:39.240,00:23:43.050
"- Right now, these vaccines have data in animals. 
- What kind of animals, can I ask?",00:23:43.050,00:23:47.550
"So, typically, they start in mice. They may
do... It depends on the company, they may do",00:23:47.550,00:23:52.290
"hamsters. I think many of the companies
are planning to do testing in monkeys.",00:23:52.290,00:23:56.400
"Because again as you move up, as you go
from mice to rabbits to monkeys, you get",00:23:56.880,00:24:02.580
"closer and closer to what the actual
responses might be in humans. People have",00:24:02.580,00:24:06.210
"seen vaccines look great in mice,
and completely fail in humans. The CEPI",00:24:06.210,00:24:12.080
"has chosen technologies that are
rapid. That we can, you know, very rapidly",00:24:12.080,00:24:17.220
"develop vaccines, and bring them to
testing in humans. Many of them have been",00:24:17.220,00:24:21.200
"used so safely in human populations that
the US FDA and the EMA",00:24:21.200,00:24:26.040
"and actually, the Ministry of Food and Drug
Safety will give them expedited reviews.",00:24:26.160,00:24:29.840
"So they don't actually need one of the
toxicology studies in animals because",00:24:29.920,00:24:33.960
"they've already been in humans. And they
look pretty safe. Or they look safe.",00:24:34.000,00:24:40.240
"And so the regulatory agencies are
saying that that's not necessary. You can go",00:24:40.240,00:24:44.840
"directly into humans because this is an
emergency.",00:24:44.860,00:24:46.960
"- Yeah.
- And...",00:24:46.960,00:24:48.720
"So that's how, you know, I guess
from the initial announcement of COVID-19",00:24:48.720,00:24:54.009
"in January, until the first CEPI
Awards, which is the first week in",00:24:54.009,00:24:58.600
"February, to the first dose in humans, it
was Moderna,",00:24:58.600,00:25:02.440
"an RNA company based in the United
States, March 17th.",00:25:02.440,00:25:07.560
"So roughly two months. And Inovio, which
is another American company that makes a",00:25:07.560,00:25:12.080
"DNA vaccine, was a month later. They're
trying to expedite this. They're trying",00:25:12.080,00:25:16.600
"to show that this works. Because the
proof that it works, or the proof a",00:25:16.600,00:25:20.080
"suggestion that it works, could
potentially create a drive to accelerate",00:25:20.080,00:25:25.509
"- the testing even faster.
- Are we on track, then, at this pace,",00:25:25.509,00:25:29.440
"to be able to develop something and get
something done in 18 months?",00:25:29.440,00:25:33.440
"We would look at the Phase 1 and Phase 2 data
from the human trials, and, you know, we",00:25:33.440,00:25:38.169
"look at it and say, ""You know, this vaccine
just doesn't give you the right",00:25:38.169,00:25:41.110
"responses. The responses are too low."" 
Or they only come up after",00:25:41.110,00:25:45.519
"the second dose, which is a month after
the first dose, and it's still too low. So,",00:25:45.519,00:25:49.929
"you know, there could be some fine-tuning,
so you wouldn't go back to start,",00:25:49.929,00:25:53.679
"you would go back and, you know, ""Well
maybe we have to design an experiment",00:25:53.679,00:25:57.610
"where we give them twice as much
vaccine."" There could be something",00:25:57.610,00:26:00.519
"called a safety signal. And we don't
think so because these vaccines have",00:26:00.519,00:26:03.940
"been tested in humans before, similar
vaccines, and they haven't given us",00:26:03.940,00:26:07.899
"safety signals before. There could... What
if you got information from the animal",00:26:07.899,00:26:11.409
"study that it didn't protect the animals?
It didn't protect monkeys against",00:26:11.409,00:26:15.100
"the infection. Would that make you reconsider
if you had protective responses, immune",00:26:15.100,00:26:21.879
"responses to the vaccine that were
already on the low side. So, again, those",00:26:21.879,00:26:25.509
"are the kinds of things that you would
look at going from Phase 2 to Phase 3.",00:26:25.509,00:26:29.259
"The other part is that, you know, maybe
coming near late fall, or let's say",00:26:29.259,00:26:34.690
"October November timeframe, you might
have 1, 2 or 3 vaccines",00:26:34.690,00:26:38.740
"that actually have data from Phase 2. Do you
want to go forward with all three, or all",00:26:38.740,00:26:43.630
"of the vaccines? Or do you want to down
select and pick only the ones you think",00:26:43.630,00:26:47.559
"might be best. And that's something,
a decision that funders have to help",00:26:47.559,00:26:51.670
"make. I mean, they'll be informed by
scientists, and probably a series of",00:26:51.670,00:26:55.030
"consultations around, ""Is this appropriate
to take forward? Do we go forward with",00:26:55.030,00:26:59.440
"- all of them? Or just the one that we think is the best? 
- Who makes a decision though?",00:26:59.440,00:27:04.280
"So with CEPI, and groups like
CEPI, there will be... There are scientific",00:27:04.280,00:27:08.920
"advisory groups that CEPI convenes that
will help them make a decision.",00:27:08.920,00:27:12.250
"I'm sure the World Health Organization
will also be involved in some of the",00:27:12.250,00:27:15.870
"decision-making and the review of the
data. Then organizations that do this all",00:27:15.870,00:27:20.080
"the time, like the Gates Foundation, or
the National Institute of Health,",00:27:20.080,00:27:23.280
"BARDA in the United States, all will have
their own groups of people who are",00:27:23.640,00:27:28.750
"helping to try to decide what to do and
how to move something forward. You know,",00:27:28.750,00:27:34.240
"if we're lucky, we can test more
than one thing. Because as you know,",00:27:34.240,00:27:38.410
"there is a risk of failure with any one
approach. And, you know, could it be",00:27:38.410,00:27:43.090
"a vaccine from the United States,
or a vaccine from Europe, or a vaccine from",00:27:43.090,00:27:46.870
"- China or Korea. We don't know at this point. 
- Do you know which country is the",00:27:46.870,00:27:51.850
"- most ahead in terms of development?
- So with CEPI funding, CEPI funded a",00:27:51.850,00:27:57.010
"European company, CureVac, two American
companies, Inovio and Moderna, and an",00:27:57.010,00:28:02.920
"Australian University, the University of
Queensland. And the Queensland approach",00:28:02.920,00:28:06.820
"is actually different. Because unlike the
DNA and RNA approaches from the other",00:28:06.820,00:28:10.450
"companies, they're looking at a protein.
And proteins are interesting because, you know,",00:28:10.450,00:28:15.600
"they're much more like a
traditional vaccine. There are protein",00:28:16.480,00:28:19.990
"vaccines that have been licensed. There
have been so far no DNA or RNA vaccines",00:28:19.990,00:28:25.540
"that have been licensed. Who knows who's
ahead at this point. We know that five or",00:28:25.540,00:28:29.500
"four groups have started trials in
humans,",00:28:29.500,00:28:32.590
"and we don't know the data yet. And
really it's the first round of data that",00:28:32.590,00:28:37.000
"- will be the most helpful. 
- Let's say everything goes according to plan, and we",00:28:37.000,00:28:42.760
"just roll this thing out smoothly, but I
think distribution is a completely",00:28:42.760,00:28:47.830
"different question. So what people are
basically wondering is that",00:28:47.830,00:28:51.640
"who's going to get it? When is it going to be my
turn basically.",00:28:51.640,00:28:54.040
"Right, no, that's actually, probably, a question, too, 
that we need to discuss now. Good news is that,",00:28:54.040,00:29:01.800
"at least, some of the vaccines are funded by
an international collaboration of",00:29:01.800,00:29:05.680
"company... Of a partnership of countries
and philanthropic organizations like the",00:29:05.680,00:29:12.370
"Gates Foundation and the Wellcome Trust,
so that would be the CEPI funded vaccines",00:29:12.370,00:29:15.970
"and there are eight of them now. In
order to get funding from CEPI, you have",00:29:15.970,00:29:20.260
"to sign a global access agreement. So,
you know, you kind of agree to make the",00:29:20.260,00:29:23.860
"vaccine available at a certain cost that
is not going to be excessive that, you know,",00:29:23.860,00:29:28.210
"will be fair to developing
countries. The other part is that we know",00:29:28.210,00:29:32.110
"that the GAVI, the vaccine alliance, 
the Global Alliance for",00:29:32.110,00:29:36.190
"Vaccines and Immunization, already has a
plan that if there's a successful",00:29:36.190,00:29:39.910
"vaccine, you know, that there will be a
mechanism for the poorest countries in",00:29:39.910,00:29:43.960
"this world to get it either at cost or
at no cost from GAVI, which runs a stockpile.",00:29:43.960,00:29:50.080
"Question that is then going to be
asked is, ""So, when does GAVI get its stockpile?",00:29:50.200,00:29:54.840
"Does the stockpile start,
you know, once the United States gets its,",00:29:54.960,00:29:58.560
"you know, share of the vaccine? Or is this
something that, you know, we all commit to?""",00:29:58.560,00:30:02.710
"And I think, within CEPI, they have a
mechanism, but they should be talking",00:30:02.720,00:30:06.280
"about how to, you know, fairly distribute
vaccine. Who needs it first? Is the health",00:30:06.280,00:30:11.080
"- care providers? 
- Yes.",00:30:11.080,00:30:12.440
Or is it countries where the virus is,00:30:12.440,00:30:14.440
"killing, you know, hundreds of thousands
of people, and has a lot of active",00:30:14.440,00:30:18.730
"ongoing cases? Or is it a country like
Korea which has largely controlled the",00:30:18.730,00:30:22.990
"outbreak but still has 50 million people
who've never seen it and, you know, would",00:30:22.990,00:30:27.700
"be susceptible? So, who gets the vaccine
first? And that's a decision that has to",00:30:27.700,00:30:31.600
"be made when we're calm and not a
decision that should be made",00:30:31.600,00:30:37.000
"when we're reaching for the, you know, the
one virus... The one vaccine that works.",00:30:37.000,00:30:42.440
"Individual countries that fund efforts,
like China or the United States, are",00:30:43.120,00:30:47.320
"probably going to require, as a part of
the funding, that the vaccine that is",00:30:47.320,00:30:51.550
"made under funding from this
country has a priority for providing",00:30:51.550,00:30:57.040
"vaccine to that country. I mean, that's
the way organizations are. Luckily, CEPI",00:30:57.040,00:31:01.780
"has also funded most of the companies.
So that there is going to be a time to",00:31:01.780,00:31:06.320
"discuss who gets how much and who
gets vaccinated first. The World Health",00:31:06.320,00:31:10.940
"Organization is also getting involved,
and so they're convening a group of",00:31:10.940,00:31:14.360
"people that includes CEPI, and the
countries, and other organizations that",00:31:14.360,00:31:18.139
"develop vaccines to initiate the
discussion around access and equity. And",00:31:18.139,00:31:23.570
"that is going to be a really critical
issue a year and a half to two years from now.",00:31:23.570,00:31:28.120
"There are a lot of flu vaccines.
As a matter of fact, I think we are",00:31:28.120,00:31:32.640
"- advised that we need to get a like a flu shot every year 
- Yes.",00:31:32.640,00:31:36.800
"Does that mean it's like a new vaccine
that's being developed every year?",00:31:37.080,00:31:41.160
"Yes, so flu vaccines are kind of an exception, right? 
I mean, because, you know, every year",00:31:41.160,00:31:46.279
"the WHO determines the formula for flu
vaccine for the northern hemisphere in",00:31:46.279,00:31:52.399
"the southern hemisphere. Because they're
different viruses in circulation at",00:31:52.399,00:31:55.730
"different times in the northern and
southern hemispheres. Sometimes they're the same.",00:31:55.730,00:31:59.720
"But often they're different.
And the thing about flu vaccine is,",00:31:59.720,00:32:04.549
"exactly, that the strains change. And
sometimes they change really",00:32:04.549,00:32:08.690
"dramatically, like H1N1 did, and then we
get really worried because people don't",00:32:08.690,00:32:13.909
"have immunity. For the strains that are
commonly found in any year to another",00:32:13.909,00:32:17.929
"year, you know, there's a little bit of
change in the influenza strain, so",00:32:17.929,00:32:25.159
"they change the vaccine slightly, or
they may keep one component the same",00:32:25.159,00:32:28.490
"because it's the same strain that's
circulating, you know, in multiple",00:32:28.490,00:32:31.460
"years. But by and large, the companies
have adapted to a system where within a",00:32:31.460,00:32:36.590
"year, they can put the new components of
the vaccine together, and get it tested",00:32:36.590,00:32:41.059
"- and approved by the regulatory agencies and... 
- That's why it's much quicker and that",00:32:41.059,00:32:45.710
"- it doesn't take 18 months or longer
- Right, because you don't necessarily have",00:32:45.710,00:32:49.820
"to do all the, you know, individual
testing and show that it works. The FDA",00:32:49.820,00:32:55.519
"or the EMA will license it based on, you
know, the immune responses. And that",00:32:55.519,00:33:00.049
"actually is really helpful. We can't do
that with COVID-19 because we don't know",00:33:00.049,00:33:03.230
"what immune responses protect. With
influenza, we're fairly certain we know",00:33:03.230,00:33:07.279
"- which ones protect and correlate with protection. 
- So I know you talked about",00:33:07.279,00:33:10.369
"the whole concept of booster. Do you
think that even if we end up developing",00:33:10.369,00:33:14.690
"some sort of a vaccine for COVID-19, 
we should continue to get it like every year?",00:33:14.690,00:33:20.640
"- Or like is it just pretty much one and done? 
- Okay, so with",00:33:20.640,00:33:24.200
"influenza we get new vac... We get
vaccinated every year. At least",00:33:24.210,00:33:27.630
"in the United States, there's a
recommendation for nearly universal",00:33:27.630,00:33:30.330
"vaccination yearly. It's not the same in
many other countries, and that's because",00:33:30.330,00:33:35.340
"the flu, the composition of the flu
vaccine changes every year. For COVID-19,",00:33:35.340,00:33:40.360
"it's one of the things we don't
know. We will only know how effective the",00:33:40.360,00:33:44.600
"vaccine is, how large the immune
response is, and how long it will last",00:33:44.610,00:33:49.380
"after we've given the vaccine. So there's
no way to know before testing how long",00:33:49.380,00:33:54.179
"the vaccine will last. So, you know, it
might be that you will need a booster if,",00:33:54.179,00:33:58.110
"especially, if COVID-19 persists and it's, you
know, circulating around the world. We",00:33:58.110,00:34:03.059
"also don't know if that happens. If it
becomes endemic, a chronic virus, or",00:34:03.059,00:34:07.320
"virus is, you know, present and comes and
goes, whether the virus will change under",00:34:07.320,00:34:13.440
"pressure from the human immune system, 
or in order to get a particular advantage.",00:34:13.440,00:34:17.720
"- Oh, so they can mutate and just... Oh man.
- So the... But the good news for now,",00:34:17.920,00:34:22.760
"and there's very little good news 
about COVID-19, but the good",00:34:23.280,00:34:26.280
"news is, you know, they've sequenced
thousands of COVID-19 viruses. Well, compared",00:34:26.310,00:34:32.099
"to the millions of infections, that's not a lot. 
And in that 30 thousand base-pair genome,",00:34:32.099,00:34:39.320
they found 11 mutations.,00:34:39.320,00:34:41.960
"So, 11 mutations is actually fairly low it's",00:34:41.960,00:34:44.940
"- tenfold lower than flu. 
- Oh, okay, that's good.",00:34:44.940,00:34:48.480
"- And it's much much lower than HIV.
- Right.",00:34:48.480,00:34:52.040
"So... and again, the bad news is that
the COVID-19 is spreading around the world.",00:34:52.040,00:34:57.680
"The one potentially good news is that
that doesn't seem to be changing that",00:34:57.690,00:35:02.099
"much, so we hope that the immune responses 
that defeat strain A will defeat strain B.",00:35:02.099,00:35:08.080
"Another thing I hear about 
is this thing called ""herd immunity.""",00:35:08.160,00:35:11.320
"You just let people get it, as opposed to,
you know, do we need to get a vaccine?",00:35:11.320,00:35:17.360
"Herd immunity, though, the issue is
really, you know, the severity of this",00:35:17.369,00:35:21.040
"disease. And it isn't actually only
the deaths, although, you know, you can",00:35:21.040,00:35:24.300
"imagine in a country of 350 million
people,",00:35:24.300,00:35:27.810
"- 2% mortality rate is... 
- A lot",00:35:27.810,00:35:31.400
"Is 7 million. And that would be 
unheard of in a modern,",00:35:31.400,00:35:36.080
"wealthy, high-income country,
well-resourced society. I mean, that",00:35:36.080,00:35:41.840
"would probably be considered
unacceptable.",00:35:41.840,00:35:43.760
"Remember that between 10 and 20 percent
of people get hospitalized. It's that.",00:35:43.760,00:35:48.710
"I mean, all of a sudden, now you're
looking at a significant proportion of",00:35:49.240,00:35:52.960
"350 million people needing
hospitalization over the course of 3 months.",00:35:52.960,00:35:57.000
"And we don't have the hospital
beds, which means that people would be",00:35:57.000,00:36:00.720
"left at home, the way they were in some
places where you know there wasn't",00:36:00.720,00:36:04.440
"appropriate... There wasn't... There was no
hospital space and people would die at home.",00:36:04.440,00:36:07.410
"You know, there's some thought that
the healthcare system, as stressed as it is,",00:36:07.410,00:36:12.090
"still provides a better option for
people who are sick, than being left at",00:36:12.090,00:36:16.710
"home on, you know, on your own to
fend for yourself. And so, it's not only the deaths.",00:36:16.720,00:36:22.920
"Is there any scientific basis 
for saying that this could cause any side effects?",00:36:22.920,00:36:27.520
"- Are there side effects if any? 
- Vaccines are given to healthy",00:36:27.520,00:36:31.400
"people to keep them healthy. So the bar
for safety is very high. It has to be.",00:36:31.410,00:36:35.760
"When we look at the safety profile for
modern vaccines, I mean, really, we have a",00:36:35.760,00:36:40.490
remarkable set of tools for public health.,00:36:40.490,00:36:44.560
"You know, we give these vaccines to
billions of people around the world,",00:36:44.960,00:36:49.950
"and they do a remarkable job in preventing
infection and death. When you're doing",00:36:49.950,00:36:54.960
"the initial stage of vaccine testing,
remember Phase 1 is all about safety.",00:36:54.960,00:36:57.780
"In Phase 2 and Phase 3 you're
continuing to collect safety information,",00:36:57.780,00:37:02.400
"and then, after Phase 3, we really are
obligated to continue to follow people",00:37:02.440,00:37:07.760
"over time in order to make sure that, you
know, if you got the vaccine and you're",00:37:07.770,00:37:12.720
"protected, that after 2 or 3 years,
if that, you know, protection wanes, could",00:37:12.720,00:37:17.910
"that make you even more susceptible to
infection. As you're doing development,",00:37:17.910,00:37:21.630
"you really want to make sure that
you ensure that people who are",00:37:21.630,00:37:24.870
"participants in the trials don't suffer
as a result of their participation, so",00:37:24.870,00:37:29.220
"that's a part of the long-term safety
follow-up. And then afterwards, once the",00:37:29.220,00:37:33.360
"vaccine is approved and, you know,
typically there are what we call Phase 4",00:37:33.360,00:37:36.900
"studies, which are for an already
approved vaccine,",00:37:36.900,00:37:40.250
"that look at a much greater extent, to a
much greater extent, and how the vaccine",00:37:40.250,00:37:44.240
"works in real life. Now, it's one thing to
do it in an experiment where you have",00:37:44.240,00:37:47.690
"some people get vaccines some people
don't,",00:37:47.690,00:37:49.880
"that's very controlled. But when you give
enough people in a population that",00:37:49.880,00:37:54.230
"vaccine, so where roughly 50%
of the population is vaccinated, you get",00:37:54.230,00:37:58.700
"protective effectiveness of 80%.
And that's actually the benefit.",00:37:58.700,00:38:03.500
"- That's the herd immunity kicking in.
- Right.",00:38:03.500,00:38:06.600
"So again, it depends, and the",00:38:07.040,00:38:09.110
"real-world data, we hope, will be even
better than the experimental data, but",00:38:09.120,00:38:12.920
"that's something that we have to monitor.
And at the same time, we have to monitor",00:38:12.920,00:38:16.240
"for long... for safety in a much greater
number of people, so the US CDC monitors",00:38:16.250,00:38:22.460
"the safety of all vaccines used in the
United States, the World Health",00:38:22.460,00:38:26.480

the world to set up these long term",00:38:26.480,00:38:31.070
"vaccine and adverse event reporting
systems that will allow them to look at",00:38:31.070,00:38:35.480
"longer term safety consequences from
vaccines as vaccines are rolled out into",00:38:35.480,00:38:39.890
"populations. So again, I mean to emphasize
that vaccines should be safe.",00:38:39.890,00:38:44.320
"We just feel that people are just being
bombarded with so much misinformation,",00:38:44.320,00:38:50.840
"something's clearly not getting through.
All the scientific facts, and",00:38:50.840,00:38:56.160
"findings, and research, and study, why are
they not getting through to the people?",00:38:56.160,00:39:01.800
"Scientists are difficult to listen to,
and doctors. And, you know, we know that",00:39:01.820,00:39:06.040
"something works. We don't necessarily
have time to explain it, you know, a lot",00:39:06.050,00:39:09.950
"of people don't necessarily oppose
vaccines, but they've heard that there",00:39:09.950,00:39:13.400
"might be you know side effects, or
they talked to someone who has a child",00:39:13.400,00:39:17.420
"that has autism, and who strongly
believes that the vaccine caused it,",00:39:17.420,00:39:22.700
"which may not... Which is not the case. And
they go into the internet and the first",00:39:22.700,00:39:26.480
"things that come up when you google
something are the the messages that are",00:39:26.480,00:39:30.070
"opposed to vaccination. And then they go
to the doctor and the doctor doesn't",00:39:30.070,00:39:34.190
"have much time to, ""Well, you don't want it?
Well, you know, in in our state it's not",00:39:34.190,00:39:38.150
"necessary for you to get it, if you... If
the parent feels that you don't need it...",00:39:38.150,00:39:41.510
"You sure you don't need it?"" And then they
leave. This is a process of engaging with",00:39:41.510,00:39:45.650
"the family, with the parents, explaining
why vaccines work and how safe they are",00:39:45.650,00:39:50.420
"and, you know, it's...
It requires time and most people want to",00:39:50.420,00:39:55.430
"know the answer. You can find lots of
answers on the Internet, and you have to",00:39:55.430,00:39:58.940
"be able to screen them. I mean, that's
actually maybe one of the problems",00:39:58.940,00:40:01.760
"during COVID-19. I'll go to an interview and
someone will say, ""So, the New York Times",00:40:01.760,00:40:05.870
"has just shown, or just published that
this is true. What do you think?"" And",00:40:05.870,00:40:11.810
"now they...  I don't remember reading that
in the New England Journal. It's a report",00:40:11.810,00:40:16.730
"now that's loaded onto a preprint server.
It hasn't been reviewed, it hasn't",00:40:16.730,00:40:20.990
"been accepted by a journal, but, you know,
the filter, which was normally the",00:40:20.990,00:40:25.310
"editors at the journal and the reviewers
of the paper, have been removed and",00:40:25.310,00:40:29.570
"we're actually looking at things before
they've actually had a true scientific",00:40:29.570,00:40:33.920
"review. And that makes it more difficult.
But how does the average person",00:40:33.920,00:40:38.150
"- interpret that?
- So that's the question.",00:40:38.150,00:40:41.080
"I mean, you see
a report from France that had",00:40:41.080,00:40:43.480
"hydroxychloroquine, you know,
significantly improved outcomes, and you",00:40:43.480,00:40:47.000
"read the report and you think, ""Mmm, this was
not done, you know, there wasn't a control",00:40:47.000,00:40:51.740
"group, they had mild infection, you
know. What... You know, how do we know that",00:40:51.740,00:40:56.780
"it actually works?
Oh, then someone like Dr. Fauci says, ""Well,",00:40:56.780,00:41:00.200
"we do a trial. We compare
hydroxychloroquine to standard of care.",00:41:00.200,00:41:04.280
"And if the hydroxychloroquine is working,
then people will come off the ventilator",00:41:04.280,00:41:08.300
"sooner, the amount of virus in their
throat swabs will decrease, or if we give",00:41:08.300,00:41:13.220
"it to people with mild disease, they
won't progress to being on a ventilator.",00:41:13.220,00:41:16.160
"And then, if you can show that compared
to doing nothing, then, you know, then it",00:41:16.160,00:41:22.130
"works. But unfortunately, we jumped to the
conclusion that it worked. And really,",00:41:22.130,00:41:27.470
"what we need is a balanced scientific
review of this, and actually a test",00:41:27.470,00:41:32.120
"designed to answer the question. Does it
work?",00:41:32.120,00:41:34.440
"What is your biggest challenge
at the moment?",00:41:34.440,00:41:36.920
"I think our biggest challenge
is, you know, we want to do more. And, you",00:41:37.000,00:41:41.840
"know, even with the staff we have, it's
getting increasingly difficult. And,",00:41:41.880,00:41:47.690
"you know, a lot of it is about funding.
The Korean government recognizes us",00:41:47.690,00:41:51.320
"because they've recently increased
funding for vaccines. As long as there's",00:41:51.320,00:41:55.970

will be, for, you know, another two years",00:41:55.970,00:41:59.960
"at least, probably...",00:41:59.960,00:42:01.560

- Not... It's not going to disappear.",00:42:01.560,00:42:04.800
"- It's with us. 
- Wow, that's...",00:42:05.360,00:42:07.520

the first time.",00:42:07.520,00:42:10.440
"We have to learn to live with a new normal.
Is the new normal, having a situation where",00:42:10.520,00:42:15.200
"a certain amount of social interaction can occur?
Around the idea that, you know, the people who are",00:42:15.200,00:42:20.840
"going to places that would potentially
be at higher risk for acquiring",00:42:20.840,00:42:25.349
"infection and bringing it back are
protected. It's spreading around the",00:42:25.360,00:42:28.739
"world and, I mean, like the Spanish flu,
it could come around again. And",00:42:28.739,00:42:33.719
"remember in Korea, there weren't that
many people infected. I mean, a lot of",00:42:33.719,00:42:37.949
"people in quarantine, not many infected,
that means that almost all Koreans could",00:42:37.949,00:42:42.659
"be infected. So it would only take, you
know, 1 or 2 new cases that are",00:42:42.659,00:42:47.729
"missed for whatever reason, 
and we could have a new Daegu.",00:42:47.729,00:42:51.600

you have more update or better news.",00:42:55.960,00:43:00.680

- Yeah, I think, you know, I think we we're all hoping for",00:43:00.840,00:43:04.880

as we can, and as fast as we can, and, you know,",00:43:04.880,00:43:09.880

could test, we'd be happy to do that. If",00:43:09.880,00:43:14.069

people into contact, or support for",00:43:14.069,00:43:18.809

the meantime, I think, you know, people",00:43:18.809,00:43:24.899

protect others. So, you know, the",00:43:24.899,00:43:29.179

distance away from people, even though",00:43:29.179,00:43:34.169
