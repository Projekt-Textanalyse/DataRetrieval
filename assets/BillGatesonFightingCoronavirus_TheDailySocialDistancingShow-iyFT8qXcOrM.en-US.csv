"Bill Gates, welcome to The Daily
Social Distancing Show.",00:00:00.000,00:00:03.337
"(chuckles):
It's great to be on.",00:00:03.337,00:00:05.339
"Let's, uh, jump straight
into the first question",00:00:05.339,00:00:07.641
"that everybody
would want me to ask.",00:00:07.641,00:00:10.210
You delivered a TED Talk,00:00:10.210,00:00:12.679
"where you predicted pretty much
what is happening now.",00:00:12.679,00:00:16.850
"Now, thanks
to the world we live in,",00:00:16.850,00:00:19.419
"that has spouted a bunch
of conspiracy theories,",00:00:19.419,00:00:21.922
"everything from
""Bill Gates invented this virus",00:00:21.922,00:00:24.324
"to prove himself right,""
or ""He knew it was gonna happen,",00:00:24.324,00:00:27.127
"and that's why he said it.""",00:00:27.127,00:00:29.129
"Was that Ted Talk
about this virus,",00:00:29.129,00:00:31.999
"or was that a hypothetical
that has now come true?",00:00:31.999,00:00:35.068
"Well, I didn't know specifically
that it'd be coronavirus",00:00:35.068,00:00:38.572
"and that it would hit
in late 2019.",00:00:38.572,00:00:42.142
"But the goal of the talk
was to encourage governments",00:00:42.142,00:00:46.613
"to make the investments
so we could respond very quickly",00:00:46.613,00:00:50.384
"and keep the case numbers
very, very low.",00:00:50.384,00:00:53.954
"And so sadly,
this is not a case where,",00:00:53.954,00:00:57.057
"you know, I feel like,
""Hey, I told you so,""",00:00:57.057,00:00:59.426
"-Mm-hmm. -uh... it,
because we didn't use that time,",00:00:59.426,00:01:03.430
"when it was clear
as the biggest threat",00:01:03.430,00:01:05.766
"to kill millions of people,",00:01:05.766,00:01:08.201
"to have the diagnostics
standing by,",00:01:08.201,00:01:11.738
"to be ready to ramp up a...
a vaccine factory.",00:01:11.738,00:01:15.542
"A few things were done,
uh, of some countries.",00:01:15.542,00:01:19.012
Our foundation funded some work,00:01:19.012,00:01:21.515
"that will help
with the vaccines now,",00:01:21.515,00:01:23.717
will help with the diagnostics.,00:01:23.717,00:01:25.118
"But, uh, you know,",00:01:25.118,00:01:27.521
"well, most of what
was called for,",00:01:27.521,00:01:30.123
"particularly in a New England
Journal of Medicine article",00:01:30.123,00:01:33.427
"I did that went
into way more specifics",00:01:33.427,00:01:35.862
"than I could
in a short TED Talk,",00:01:35.862,00:01:38.865
"uh, those things
didn't get done,",00:01:38.865,00:01:42.602
"and so that's why
it's taking us a long time",00:01:42.602,00:01:45.539
"to get our act together, uh,
faced with this threat.",00:01:45.539,00:01:48.675
"Here's a question I have, um,
as an individual.",00:01:48.675,00:01:52.546
"How is it that you
as a nongovernment",00:01:52.546,00:01:56.216
"knew this information and knew
that it needed to be act on...",00:01:56.216,00:01:59.486
"acted on, and governments
and organizations",00:01:59.486,00:02:02.656
"that are specifically tasked
with protecting people",00:02:02.656,00:02:05.025
from this very thing,00:02:05.025,00:02:06.593
"either didn't have
the information or ignored it?",00:02:06.593,00:02:08.695
"What-what do you think
happened there?",00:02:08.695,00:02:10.130
"Because I know you interact
with governments.",00:02:10.130,00:02:11.732
"You talk to organizations
like the CDC, like the WHO.",00:02:11.732,00:02:15.702
What went wrong?,00:02:15.702,00:02:17.170
"Well, there are lots
of individuals,",00:02:17.170,00:02:19.039
"uh, who were as worried
as I was.",00:02:19.039,00:02:22.943
"You know, people like Dr. Fauci,",00:02:22.943,00:02:24.745
"who'd been through
various epidemics.",00:02:24.745,00:02:27.781
"And, so, when we had Ebola,",00:02:27.781,00:02:30.917
"Zika, SARS, MERS,",00:02:30.917,00:02:33.553
"we were lucky that they didn't
transmit very easily.",00:02:33.553,00:02:37.524
"They weren't, uh,
these respiratory viruses",00:02:37.524,00:02:40.427
"where somebody
who's not very symptomatic",00:02:40.427,00:02:42.829
"and is still walking around
can spread the disease,",00:02:42.829,00:02:46.033
"in some cases
to literally dozens of people.",00:02:46.033,00:02:48.935
"So the respiratory transmission,",00:02:48.935,00:02:51.805
"particularly because
world travel is so intense,",00:02:51.805,00:02:55.008
"that's where I show
the simulation in that speech",00:02:55.008,00:02:58.979
"and say,
""This keeps me up at night,",00:02:58.979,00:03:01.481
"uh, more than even war,""",00:03:01.481,00:03:04.017
which is no small thing.,00:03:04.017,00:03:06.219
"And yet,
in terms of being systematic",00:03:06.219,00:03:10.057
"about, okay,
let's run a simulation",00:03:10.057,00:03:13.960
"and see how would we reach out
to the private sector",00:03:13.960,00:03:17.697
for tests or ventilators,00:03:17.697,00:03:20.133
"and, uh, what kind of quarantine
would we do?",00:03:20.133,00:03:23.904
"You know, as we enter into this,",00:03:23.904,00:03:26.406
we haven't practiced at all.,00:03:26.406,00:03:28.709
"And so you can see it's,
you know,",00:03:28.709,00:03:31.411
"every state is being forced to
figure things out on their own,",00:03:31.411,00:03:34.614
"-and, uh, it's very ad hoc.
-Mm-hmm.",00:03:34.614,00:03:37.150
It's not like when a war comes,00:03:37.150,00:03:39.352
"and we've done,
you know, 20 simulations",00:03:39.352,00:03:42.355
of various types of threats,00:03:42.355,00:03:44.925
"and we've made sure
that the training,",00:03:44.925,00:03:47.160
"communications, logistics,",00:03:47.160,00:03:49.162
"all those pieces fall into place
very rapidly.",00:03:49.162,00:03:53.033
"You are
in an interesting position",00:03:53.033,00:03:56.536
"where, in many ways,
you are an expert on this topic",00:03:56.536,00:03:59.473
"because of the work
that you now do in philanthropy.",00:03:59.473,00:04:03.009
"You know, your goal has been
to eradicate malaria",00:04:03.009,00:04:06.046
"across the globe,
focusing in Africa.",00:04:06.046,00:04:08.915
"You work
with infectious disease.",00:04:08.915,00:04:11.685
"You work with experts in
and around infectious disease.",00:04:11.685,00:04:14.654
"When you look at the coronavirus
as it stands now...",00:04:14.654,00:04:18.258
"It's happened.
Leaders acted late.",00:04:18.258,00:04:20.627
"But what do you think
needs to be done going forward?",00:04:20.627,00:04:23.730
"You wrote an interesting op-ed
about this,",00:04:23.730,00:04:25.398
"but what do you think we need
to do from the ground up?",00:04:25.398,00:04:27.734
"From the people to the leaders
to the private sector?",00:04:27.734,00:04:30.770
"Well, the main tools
we have right now",00:04:30.770,00:04:34.040
"are the behavioral change,",00:04:34.040,00:04:37.144
"the social distancing,",00:04:37.144,00:04:39.679
"which, uh, often means staying
at home most of the time,",00:04:39.679,00:04:43.583
"and the testing capacity
to identify",00:04:43.583,00:04:47.454
"who in particular
needs to get isolated",00:04:47.454,00:04:50.924
and then testing their contacts,00:04:50.924,00:04:53.260
"to make sure
that we can catch it so early",00:04:53.260,00:04:56.296
"that a lot of people
who get sick",00:04:56.296,00:04:57.764
don't infect anyone else.,00:04:57.764,00:05:00.433
"Now, you know, so,
our foundation is engaged",00:05:00.433,00:05:03.403
"in projecting, uh,
what's going to go on,",00:05:03.403,00:05:06.373
the modeling.,00:05:06.373,00:05:07.440
"Uh, our partner IHME",00:05:07.440,00:05:10.177
"is, you know, telling each state
what they should think about",00:05:10.177,00:05:13.580
"in terms of ventilators
and capacity.",00:05:13.580,00:05:16.816
"Further on out,
the work we're doing now",00:05:16.816,00:05:19.252
"to find a therapeutic,
a drug to reduce the disease,",00:05:19.252,00:05:22.989
"to cut the deaths down,
you know,",00:05:22.989,00:05:24.858
"we're hopeful, uh,
that even in six months,",00:05:24.858,00:05:27.894
"some of those
will have been approved.",00:05:27.894,00:05:29.763
"Uh, but the ultimate solution,",00:05:29.763,00:05:32.299
"the only thing
that really lets us",00:05:32.299,00:05:34.534
go back completely to normal,00:05:34.534,00:05:36.770
"and feel good
about sitting in a stadium",00:05:36.770,00:05:39.039
"with lots of other people
is to create a vaccine",00:05:39.039,00:05:42.442
"and not just take care
of our country",00:05:42.442,00:05:44.978
but take that vaccine out,00:05:44.978,00:05:47.047
to the global population,00:05:47.047,00:05:50.217
"and, uh, so that we have
vast immunity",00:05:50.217,00:05:54.154
"and this thing, no matter what,",00:05:54.154,00:05:56.590
"isn't going to spread
in large numbers.",00:05:56.590,00:05:59.092
You have a unique vantage point,00:05:59.092,00:06:01.795
"in that
you have been communicating",00:06:01.795,00:06:03.863
"with various governments
around the world",00:06:03.863,00:06:05.632
"in and around
their COVID-19 response,",00:06:05.632,00:06:08.602
"um, what they plan to do",00:06:08.602,00:06:10.437
"and what they-they haven't done
thus far.",00:06:10.437,00:06:13.607
"Which countries do you think
we should be looking to",00:06:13.607,00:06:16.409
"for models that work,
and can we apply those models",00:06:16.409,00:06:19.646
"to a larger country
like the United States?",00:06:19.646,00:06:21.548
"So, you know,
many people say Italy and Korea,",00:06:21.548,00:06:24.217
"yes, have their numbers,",00:06:24.217,00:06:25.518
"but they can't necessarily
be applied to America.",00:06:25.518,00:06:27.887
Is that true or not?,00:06:27.887,00:06:29.322
"Or is there a model
that does seem to work",00:06:29.322,00:06:31.591
"and should be followed
for everybody?",00:06:31.591,00:06:33.159
"Well, countries
have differences.",00:06:33.159,00:06:35.161
"You know, uh, South Korea",00:06:35.161,00:06:36.963
"did get
a medium-sized infection,",00:06:36.963,00:06:39.766
"but then they used testing,",00:06:39.766,00:06:42.168
"enforced quarantine,
contact tracing",00:06:42.168,00:06:44.537
"and really bent the curve,",00:06:44.537,00:06:46.506
"uh, even though it looked
pretty scary there for a while.",00:06:46.506,00:06:49.609
"The epidemic
in the United States",00:06:49.609,00:06:51.911
"is more widespread, uh,
than it ever got in South Korea.",00:06:51.911,00:06:55.715
"So we're like the part of China,
uh, Hubei province,",00:06:55.715,00:06:59.653
"where a lot of the cases
were in one city, Wuhan.",00:06:59.653,00:07:03.023
"And the U.S. and China
are different.",00:07:03.023,00:07:05.492
"You know,
the lockdowns that we do",00:07:05.492,00:07:07.494
"won't be as strictly enforced,",00:07:07.494,00:07:09.929
"but they are very,
very important.",00:07:09.929,00:07:12.065
The way we do contact tracing,00:07:12.065,00:07:14.034
"won't be as, uh, invasive",00:07:14.034,00:07:16.703
"and so won't be
quite as perfect.",00:07:16.703,00:07:18.605
"But it is very good news
that China,",00:07:18.605,00:07:22.075
"uh, although they're maintaining
a lot of measures,",00:07:22.075,00:07:25.945
they are not seeing a rebound.,00:07:25.945,00:07:28.348
"They're not seeing cases
coming back",00:07:28.348,00:07:30.183
"even though they are sending
people back to the factories,",00:07:30.183,00:07:34.120
sending people back to schools.,00:07:34.120,00:07:36.222
"And, you know,
so, thank goodness,",00:07:36.222,00:07:38.825
"if we're seeing
a big rebound there,",00:07:38.825,00:07:41.127
"uh, the idea
you could keep it under control",00:07:41.127,00:07:43.596
"once you have
a large number of cases,",00:07:43.596,00:07:46.533
"like the U.S. does
and many countries in Europe,",00:07:46.533,00:07:50.537
"then it, you know,
would seem almost impossible.",00:07:50.537,00:07:54.140
So it can be done.,00:07:54.140,00:07:55.909
"You know, China ended up",00:07:55.909,00:07:57.177
"with .01%
of their population infected.",00:07:57.177,00:08:00.447
"You know, our goal is to stay
so it's only a few percent",00:08:00.447,00:08:04.317
"so at least the medical penalty,
uh, isn't gigantic",00:08:04.317,00:08:08.221
"even though the economic penalty
will be very large.",00:08:08.221,00:08:12.158
"When-when you look
at that balance",00:08:12.158,00:08:13.993
"between the economic penalty
and, um, the human penalty,",00:08:13.993,00:08:17.497
"there are some who have argued
that the economic penalty",00:08:17.497,00:08:21.134
"will, over time,
equal the human penalty.",00:08:21.134,00:08:25.038
"Now, you are one
of the few people in the world",00:08:25.038,00:08:26.840
"where you actually have
enough money",00:08:26.840,00:08:29.075
"to tell us about whether or not
an economy shifting",00:08:29.075,00:08:32.245
"in this way or another way
is going to cause mass deaths.",00:08:32.245,00:08:35.515
"But how do you think
we should be looking at this?",00:08:35.515,00:08:37.851
"Because, yes,
there is an economy,",00:08:37.851,00:08:39.185
"and, yes, there is human life,",00:08:39.185,00:08:40.353
"but where do you think
the truth lies?",00:08:40.353,00:08:42.122
"Well, the, uh...",00:08:42.122,00:08:44.758
"There isn't a choice
where you get to say to people,",00:08:44.758,00:08:48.628
"""Don't pay attention
to this epidemic.""",00:08:48.628,00:08:52.198
"Uh, you know, most people,",00:08:52.198,00:08:55.035
"uh, they have older relatives.",00:08:55.035,00:08:57.604
"You know, they're worried
about getting sick.",00:08:57.604,00:09:00.240
"Uh, the idea of a normal economy",00:09:00.240,00:09:04.210
is not there as a choice.,00:09:04.210,00:09:05.945
"You know, about 80% of people",00:09:05.945,00:09:08.214
"are going to change
their activities.",00:09:08.214,00:09:10.550
If you get the other 20%,00:09:10.550,00:09:12.919
"to go along with that
nationwide,",00:09:12.919,00:09:15.755
then the disease numbers come...,00:09:15.755,00:09:18.458
"will flatten,
hopefully in the next month,",00:09:18.458,00:09:20.894
"and start to go down,",00:09:20.894,00:09:22.695
"hopefully in the month
after that.",00:09:22.695,00:09:24.431
"And then
when they've gone down a lot,",00:09:24.431,00:09:26.966
"then, in a tasteful way,",00:09:26.966,00:09:29.235
"using prioritized testing,",00:09:29.235,00:09:31.304
"you can start

going up.",00:12:57.944,00:13:00.213

"who aren't getting tested
and are recovering.",00:13:08.955,00:13:11.024

this disease actually is.",00:13:14.160,00:13:17.630

what I'm trying to say is,",00:13:20.800,00:13:22.468

get as many tests as possible,",00:13:22.468,00:13:24.671

many people as we have tested,",00:13:24.671,00:13:28.341

"rich countries that do
the right policies,",00:13:33.880,00:13:37.884

to, uh, plateau",00:13:37.884,00:13:41.421

they are countries",00:13:48.995,00:13:50.930

have achieved that,",00:13:50.930,00:13:53.466

that your total deaths,",00:13:53.466,00:13:56.002

gigantic. -Mm-hmm.",00:13:56.002,00:13:59.939

"the ability to do lots
of testing,",00:14:01.674,00:14:04.877

have severe respiratory distress",00:14:04.877,00:14:08.815
"get treatment, uh,
and do this social isolation,",00:14:08.815,00:14:13.086

it's far harder.",00:14:13.086,00:14:16.022

"will these measures
actually stop it",00:14:18.925,00:14:21.861

of the population,",00:14:21.861,00:14:24.797

uh, President Ramaphosa today,",00:14:26.799,00:14:30.470

of South Africa,",00:14:30.470,00:14:33.473

of the African Union.",00:14:33.473,00:14:35.475

to act quickly,00:14:40.313,00:14:41.914

uh, is still fairly low,",00:14:41.914,00:14:46.085

Sub-Saharan Africa right now.",00:14:46.085,00:14:50.823
"When you look
at where we are now,",00:14:50.823,00:14:54.961
the one thing that we can't deny,00:14:54.961,00:14:56.496
"is everybody has dealt
with the coronavirus",00:14:56.496,00:14:59.565
on a different timeline.,00:14:59.565,00:15:00.833
"You know?
Not just across the globe.",00:15:00.833,00:15:02.835
"I mean,
even within the United States.",00:15:02.835,00:15:04.337
"You have states
like Georgia and Florida",00:15:04.337,00:15:06.139
"that have just implemented
stay-at-home orders.",00:15:06.139,00:15:08.141
"You have many other states
that haven't done it at all.",00:15:08.141,00:15:11.978
"Is this going to fundamentally
undermine the efforts",00:15:11.978,00:15:16.048
"of other states
and other countries",00:15:16.048,00:15:18.184
that have shut themselves down?,00:15:18.184,00:15:19.719
"Because if the numbers dip
in one country",00:15:19.719,00:15:22.989
"and another country hasn't had
the same amount of, um,",00:15:22.989,00:15:27.460
"shutdowns
or people self-quarantining--",00:15:27.460,00:15:29.796
"for instance, if people
from Brazil travel after this",00:15:29.796,00:15:32.298
"or if people from, uh--
whether it's Belarus or Hungary",00:15:32.298,00:15:34.767
"or any other country
where a leader",00:15:34.767,00:15:36.169
"hasn't taken it seriously,",00:15:36.169,00:15:37.370
"will that not undermine
the effort completely?",00:15:37.370,00:15:39.305
"Is-is there a point
to doing this",00:15:39.305,00:15:41.240
when everybody isn't doing it?,00:15:41.240,00:15:44.110
"Well, sadly,",00:15:44.110,00:15:45.645
"at some level of wealth,",00:15:45.645,00:15:47.446
"there will be countries that,
no matter how hard they try,",00:15:47.446,00:15:50.316
"they will have
a widespread epidemic.",00:15:50.316,00:15:52.919
"And so, again,",00:15:52.919,00:15:56.055
"sadly, the richer countries
that do contain the epidemic",00:15:56.055,00:16:00.193
"will not allow people
from those countries",00:16:00.193,00:16:04.864
"to come in, you know,
unless they are quarantined",00:16:04.864,00:16:08.734
"or tested
or-or proved they're immune.",00:16:08.734,00:16:11.938
"Uh, and so this is gonna stop
people going across borders",00:16:11.938,00:16:15.474
"very dramatically
these next few years",00:16:15.474,00:16:18.344
"till we get
to that full vaccination.",00:16:18.344,00:16:20.880
"Within the United States
is different,",00:16:20.880,00:16:23.082
"because we're not gonna
partition the country.",00:16:23.082,00:16:25.618
"Uh, and so, therefore,
we are all in it together.",00:16:25.618,00:16:29.555
"We can't do what we're gonna do
with foreign nationals,",00:16:29.555,00:16:32.925
"which is reduce
the numbers a lot",00:16:32.925,00:16:35.261
"and have very strict screening
there.",00:16:35.261,00:16:37.330
"We're not gonna have
at every state border,",00:16:37.330,00:16:39.866
"you know,
some complex quarantine center.",00:16:39.866,00:16:42.869
"Uh, and-and
so the whole country needs--",00:16:42.869,00:16:47.039
"Even when you have
small numbers,",00:16:47.039,00:16:48.908
"because those can exponentiate
to big numbers so quickly.",00:16:48.908,00:16:52.245
"You know, the doubling time
is, like, three days",00:16:52.245,00:16:54.647
"when you're still behaving,",00:16:54.647,00:16:56.515
"uh, in the pre-epidemic way.",00:16:56.515,00:17:00.519
"Uh, so, you know,
each country,",00:17:00.519,00:17:03.322
"uh, you know,
has to get the entire populace,",00:17:03.322,00:17:06.425
"even some who-who, uh,",00:17:06.425,00:17:08.828
"initially resisted,",00:17:08.828,00:17:10.897
"-maybe for very good reasons,
-Mm-hmm.",00:17:10.897,00:17:12.565
"because the economic effect
on them, uh, is-is strong.",00:17:12.565,00:17:16.769
So this is powerful medicine.,00:17:16.769,00:17:18.504
"But if you take a big dose of it
earlier,",00:17:18.504,00:17:21.507
"you-you don't have to take it
for nearly as long.",00:17:21.507,00:17:25.378
"You were one of the first people
to come out",00:17:25.378,00:17:29.348
"and, um, donate a large chunk
of money",00:17:29.348,00:17:33.052
to fighting coronavirus,00:17:33.052,00:17:35.588
"or helping medical workers get
the equipment they need.",00:17:35.588,00:17:38.124
"I remember the last I read,",00:17:38.124,00:17:39.458
"it was yourself
and your wife Melinda",00:17:39.458,00:17:41.193
"who had pledged
over $100 million.",00:17:41.193,00:17:43.763
"It seems, though,
that money isn't able",00:17:43.763,00:17:47.066
to fix this problem.,00:17:47.066,00:17:49.068
"It seems like governments around
the world are trying everything",00:17:49.068,00:17:51.504
"they can, but it doesn't seem
like it can be fixed.",00:17:51.504,00:17:54.240
"What are you hoping to achieve
in this moment in time?",00:17:54.240,00:17:57.243
"Well, you... If we get
the right testing capacity,",00:17:57.243,00:18:00.880
"you can change
by literally millions, uh,",00:18:00.880,00:18:04.183
the number who are infected.,00:18:04.183,00:18:06.252
And governments will eventually,00:18:06.252,00:18:07.954
"come up with lots
of money for these things,",00:18:07.954,00:18:09.989
"but they don't know
where to direct it,",00:18:09.989,00:18:12.024
they can't move as quickly.,00:18:12.024,00:18:13.626
"And so because, you know,
our foundation has",00:18:13.626,00:18:16.596
"such deep expertise
in infectious diseases,",00:18:16.596,00:18:19.532
"we've thought
about the epidemic.",00:18:19.532,00:18:21.567
"We did fund some things, uh,",00:18:21.567,00:18:24.070
"to be more prepared,
like a-a vaccine effort.",00:18:24.070,00:18:27.707
"Uh, our early money
can accelerate things.",00:18:27.707,00:18:32.044
"So, for example, there's...",00:18:32.044,00:18:33.946
"Uh, of all
the vaccine constructs,",00:18:33.946,00:18:36.215
"the seven most promising
of those,",00:18:36.215,00:18:38.451
"even though we'll end up picking
at most two of them,",00:18:38.451,00:18:41.854
"we're going to fund factories
for all seven.",00:18:41.854,00:18:44.624
"And just so
that we don't waste time",00:18:44.624,00:18:48.127
"in serially saying,",00:18:48.127,00:18:50.696
"-Oh, wow.
-""Okay, which vaccine works?""",00:18:50.696,00:18:52.598
and then building the factory.,00:18:52.598,00:18:54.734
"Because to get
to the best case, uh,",00:18:54.734,00:18:58.137
"that people like myself
and Dr. Fauci are saying",00:18:58.137,00:19:00.806
"is about 18 months,",00:19:00.806,00:19:02.441
"we need to do safety
and efficacy",00:19:02.441,00:19:04.677
and build manufacturing.,00:19:04.677,00:19:07.079
"Uh, and they're different
for the different constructs.",00:19:07.079,00:19:10.449
And so we'll abandon...,00:19:10.449,00:19:11.884
"You know, it'll be
a few billion dollars",00:19:11.884,00:19:13.753
we'll waste on manufacturing,00:19:13.753,00:19:15.955
"for the constructs
that don't get picked",00:19:15.955,00:19:18.290
"because something else
is better.",00:19:18.290,00:19:20.226
But a few billion in this...,00:19:20.226,00:19:22.094
"the-the situation
where we're in,",00:19:22.094,00:19:24.196
"where there's trillions
of dollars--",00:19:24.196,00:19:26.165
"that's a thousand times more--
uh, trillions of dollars",00:19:26.165,00:19:29.935
"being lost economically,",00:19:29.935,00:19:32.538
it is worth it.,00:19:32.538,00:19:34.940
"In normal government
procurement processes,",00:19:34.940,00:19:37.743
"and understanding
which are the right seven,",00:19:37.743,00:19:39.979
"you know, in a few months,
those may kick in.",00:19:39.979,00:19:43.115
"But our foundation, you know,
we can get that bootstrapped",00:19:43.115,00:19:46.986
"and get it going, uh,",00:19:46.986,00:19:48.888
"and, you know, save months
because every month counts.",00:19:48.888,00:19:53.626
"You know,
things can reopen if thing...",00:19:53.626,00:19:56.095
"if-if... if we do
the right things, in the summer,",00:19:56.095,00:19:58.798
"but it won't be
completely normal.",00:19:58.798,00:20:01.667
You'll still be very worried.,00:20:01.667,00:20:03.469
"You know, we may decide
masks are important,",00:20:03.469,00:20:05.938
"although right now, they're in
short supply for health workers,",00:20:05.938,00:20:08.941
"so people should not, uh,
go and-and hoard those.",00:20:08.941,00:20:12.511
"But the capacity
of that can be brought up.",00:20:12.511,00:20:15.147
"So it may be something that,
like China today,",00:20:15.147,00:20:18.184
"everybody who's walking around
is wearing one of those.",00:20:18.184,00:20:22.121
"-So we'll have a lot
of unusual measures... -Mm-hmm.",00:20:22.121,00:20:24.457
"...until we get
the world vaccinated.",00:20:24.457,00:20:26.725
"You know, seven billion people--",00:20:26.725,00:20:28.494
"-that's a tall order.
-Mm-hmm.",00:20:28.494,00:20:30.029
"But it is...
it is where we need to get to,",00:20:30.029,00:20:33.099
"uh, despite a lot of things
in between now and then,",00:20:33.099,00:20:37.570
to minimize the damage.,00:20:37.570,00:20:39.572
"You predicted this pandemic
almost to a T.",00:20:39.572,00:20:43.809
"And maybe it was
because we were dealing",00:20:43.809,00:20:46.812
"with other things at the time,",00:20:46.812,00:20:48.147
"we didn't really pay
that much attention.",00:20:48.147,00:20:50.216
"Is there anything else
you want to warn us about now",00:20:50.216,00:20:52.551
"-that-that we should be
looking forward to? -(laughs)",00:20:52.551,00:20:54.787
"Is there anything else
that keeps you up at night?",00:20:54.787,00:20:57.022
"Well, this is
a naturally-caused epidemic,",00:20:57.022,00:21:00.159
"and as bad as it is,",00:21:00.159,00:21:02.328
"it looks, if you have
reasonable treatment,",00:21:02.328,00:21:05.431
to have a one percent fatality.,00:21:05.431,00:21:07.333
"There could be epidemics
that are worse than that,",00:21:07.333,00:21:11.937
"including ones
that aren't naturally-caused",00:21:11.937,00:21:15.040
"that are a form
of bioterrorism.",00:21:15.040,00:21:17.076
"But I do... One thing
I feel good about is",00:21:17.076,00:21:19.678
"this is such a big, uh, change,
to the world",00:21:19.678,00:21:23.749
"that this time,
it won't be like Ebola,",00:21:23.749,00:21:27.586
"which was just there in
West Africa or Central Africa.",00:21:27.586,00:21:30.222
"This time, the tens of billions",00:21:30.222,00:21:33.025
"to have the diagnostics
standing by,",00:21:33.025,00:21:35.194
"the vaccine manufacturing
standing by--",00:21:35.194,00:21:37.530
"this time we will, uh,",00:21:37.530,00:21:39.932
get ready for the next epidemic.,00:21:39.932,00:21:42.468
"Well, I hope your words are
prophetic once again.",00:21:42.468,00:21:45.404
Thank you so much for your time.,00:21:45.404,00:21:47.072
"Um, good luck
in all of your work",00:21:47.072,00:21:48.941
"and, um, stay healthy out there.
We need you.",00:21:48.941,00:21:50.943
"Hey, thanks, Trevor.",00:21:50.943,00:21:52.278
"Hopefully, we'll be playing
tennis again soon.",00:21:52.278,00:21:53.712
"You bet.
Looking forward to it.",00:21:53.712,00:21:56.715
