not because the government agreed",00:02:00.780,00:02:03.500

think differently or deal with it.,00:03:18.079,00:03:20.627
I just try to explain it like that,00:03:20.627,00:03:23.870
"Even before we focus on
have targeted special killer viruses",00:03:23.870,00:03:31.280
Because it is only from the 1970s that we had in the,00:03:31.280,00:03:35.570
"70s ever one
Swine flu",00:03:35.570,00:03:37.790
and then there were SARS and MOERS ... but that was already in the 2000s,00:03:37.790,00:03:42.850
"Swine flu in 2010 and now
the COVID that now overshadows everything.",00:03:42.850,00:03:48.739
"But what was before the seventies
years? How could humanity",00:03:48.739,00:03:53.540
"survive, even before the 70s
Years and also in the years",00:03:53.540,00:03:56.900
"in between we now had 18 in 2017
also a severe flu wave because of the",00:03:56.900,00:04:01.040
"Winter was very severe. How could that
Survive mankind up to these 5-6",00:04:01.040,00:04:06.709

"do they come from here ?!
Yes, who can find them and why can you find them ?!",00:04:15.860,00:04:20.360
"Why don't you just stay with it?
feet on the floor and look at what",00:04:20.360,00:04:25.330
"really going out in numbers in this world
is because we have until the end of december",00:04:25.330,00:04:30.200
"around the end of march every year
Flu wave.",00:04:30.200,00:04:32.200
Each year,00:04:32.200,00:04:34.820
"I'm deliberately saying flu wave, we
but could also say one",00:04:34.820,00:04:39.200
Accumulation of flu infections.,00:04:39.200,00:04:43.580
"Because we have over 3500 different ones
Colds or flu",00:04:43.580,00:04:49.220
"or flu infections pathogens that are in the
microbiology are well known",00:04:49.220,00:04:55.310
"but we only have our focus now
aim at this one germ",00:04:55.310,00:04:59.570
"this germ is now a monster 
highly stylized",00:04:59.570,00:05:02.959
But if we do that now,00:05:02.959,00:05:04.550
"Look at case numbers, China is now
already through and has little more",00:05:04.550,00:05:08.410
"New cases and the numbers
are now stagnating at 80,000",00:05:08.410,00:05:13.880
"What do these numbers mean?
That means from the first case to",00:05:13.880,00:05:20.030
"for the last 80,000 people fell ill
were",00:05:20.030,00:05:24.620
"but this curve was like that, rose and now it has",00:05:24.620,00:05:28.850
"reached a plateau and now we are
almost down again because China has",00:05:28.850,00:05:31.940
"hardly any new illness when the Covid
Virus would be so evil why is it now",00:05:31.940,00:05:38.120
"don't just exterminate china that's a
1.4 billion state and if you do that",00:05:38.120,00:05:43.820
"extrapolate now, we only have 80,000
 positive cases.",00:05:43.820,00:05:50.510
"What about all the other people who have a very slight fever, slight",00:05:50.510,00:05:54.620
Had cold symptoms and the corona virus like almost all people,00:05:54.620,00:05:59.300
"have been through - they will be
not tested.",00:05:59.300,00:06:01.700
"That means we have one here 
large number of unreported diseases",00:06:01.700,00:06:06.710
which we associate with a virus that is completely harmless and,00:06:06.710,00:06:10.669
"they are asymptomatic
does not count at all.",00:06:10.669,00:06:14.340
"That's why epidemiologists have it
really great that they say we",00:06:14.340,00:06:19.289
"just count in any case. That is from
end of December, where the first fall",00:06:19.289,00:06:24.030
"has occurred, the countdown is running. It
is counted on and on: another case,",00:06:24.030,00:06:28.349
"another case and then it says in the
Press:",00:06:28.349,00:06:30.900
"China 80,000 upwards sufferers - 
Infected! - because one speaks of",00:06:30.900,00:06:36.180
"Infected. What does it awaken in the
Population?",00:06:36.180,00:06:39.330
"Wow! They have 80,000 people who are infected
and they are all highly contagious!",00:06:39.330,00:06:44.699
"It doesn't come with a syllable at all
mentioned that 95 percent of them already",00:06:44.699,00:06:49.199
"are healthy for a long time and nothing
to have.",00:06:49.199,00:06:51.909
Or maybe just had some symptoms.,00:06:51.909,00:06:53.909
And then of course comes with this panic,00:06:53.909,00:06:58.560
"now in the background: The new virus is
a killer virus. In the beginning you have",00:06:58.560,00:07:03.389
"also spoken of 5% death rates
now you had to do it again",00:07:03.389,00:07:07.830
"divide very down we are now
already 0.2 percent in China.",00:07:07.830,00:07:12.449
"If we just all the others
Cases of illness now include",00:07:12.449,00:07:15.990
"now of course they are coming
Test procedures still come into play.",00:07:15.990,00:07:19.590
How do you actually test that ?!,00:07:19.590,00:07:21.480
"For me, the question is very basic, how do you have that",00:07:21.480,00:07:24.659
"actually found this new evil
Killer virus ?!",00:07:24.659,00:07:27.722
"Yes, that's something really exciting.",00:07:27.722,00:07:29.070
"So you have to imagine in
China is now starting a wave of flu.",00:07:29.070,00:07:33.810
"It catch on people one
To develop pneumonia",00:07:33.810,00:07:38.280
"mainly old people in China
the first 5-6 cases were all",00:07:38.280,00:07:42.030
"well over 80 years old. And they have
now pneumonia",00:07:42.030,00:07:45.960
"developed and died. If we
Viruses not in our mindset at all,",00:07:45.960,00:07:49.770
"not in our consciousness at all
we would only perceive:",00:07:49.770,00:07:53.250
"Yes, now the flu wave is coming.
Now old people and die",00:07:53.250,00:07:57.060
"Course is in comparison to the
Previous years were negligible",00:07:57.060,00:08:00.930
"as in Germany! We have
vanishingly small number of cases.",00:08:00.930,00:08:05.310
"If we just do that as
Would look at the course of flu infections.",00:08:05.310,00:08:09.780
"So, in China 4 - 5 are getting sick
People and an ophthalmologist is starting now",00:08:09.780,00:08:15.509
"to search for a new virus and
to find. Why an ophthalmologist ?!",00:08:15.509,00:08:20.180
"Why not a polmologist, a virologist?
An eye doctor now finds this",00:08:20.180,00:08:25.699
new virus. Why did he look for it at all ?!,00:08:25.699,00:08:28.460
"We have to do that too
questioning! Why is an ophthalmologist looking for",00:08:28.460,00:08:32.120
"a new virus and then dies
still at it ?!",00:08:32.120,00:08:35.899
"That's the headlines, that's the one
hammer.",00:08:35.899,00:08:38.122
And they're shaking the whole thing now,00:08:38.122,00:08:39.589
World in this panic.,00:08:39.589,00:08:41.100
"If we didn't know this virus at all, it would be",00:08:41.100,00:08:44.330
it was a completely harmless flu course.,00:08:44.330,00:08:46.595
"Of course, people are the ones now",00:08:46.595,00:08:48.800
"are affected - there is always
severe flu infections.",00:08:48.800,00:08:53.270
I've also had the flu where I almost got pneumonia,00:08:53.270,00:08:56.930
but this is normal course!,00:08:56.930,00:08:59.017
"Statistically speaking, it is a normal course.",00:08:59.017,00:09:01.730
"This is because we are simple
no more vitamin D in winter",00:09:01.730,00:09:05.839
"implement because our sun position is too low, because we don't go out enough",00:09:05.839,00:09:09.860
Vitamin deficiency!,00:09:09.860,00:09:11.223
So these are the factors that add to this,00:09:11.223,00:09:14.630
"contribute that our immune system in
Winter is more susceptible.",00:09:14.630,00:09:16.630
"Yes, and I say",00:09:16.630,00:09:19.010
"sometimes Christmas maybe
far too much ""celebrated""?",00:09:19.010,00:09:21.800
"Yes, that may also add to that
that we contribute with Christmas and",00:09:21.800,00:09:25.459
"Chocolate and lots of sugar, alcohol,
poor nutrition actually",00:09:25.459,00:09:29.029
also strain our immune system.,00:09:29.029,00:09:31.085
And then there is cold ...,00:09:31.085,00:09:34.040
Would you tidy yourself over the winter,00:09:34.040,00:09:39.650
"feed, speaks a lot of fruits, vitamin C, hot tea,",00:09:39.650,00:09:45.820
"Dietary supplements in the sense of
Vitamins, ... then they stay",00:09:45.820,00:09:49.310
People healthy too. That's what you can explain now,00:09:49.310,00:09:54.770
why children is so little concerned.,00:09:54.770,00:09:56.770
Yes exactly!,00:09:56.770,00:09:58.550
"And if they do, then they are very easy
Symptoms.",00:09:58.550,00:10:01.203
But now the kids are,00:10:01.203,00:10:02.660
"again declared as a bio-terrorist,
because they have it but they won't",00:10:02.660,00:10:06.980
"sick of it. That's why everyone is going now
Schools closed ...",00:10:06.980,00:10:10.839
"The children will definitely be happy
that they are not going to school now",00:10:10.839,00:10:15.920
"have to. But it's not that funny
of course that that happens.",00:10:15.920,00:10:20.660
"I have a lot of medical colleagues who say
I can lock my practice.",00:10:20.660,00:10:24.290
"My medical assistants can't
come more because",00:10:24.290,00:10:27.200
the school and kindergartens are too.,00:10:27.200,00:10:31.010
"Even in hospitals all the sisters who work there, the",00:10:31.010,00:10:35.030
everyone can no longer work ...,00:10:35.030,00:10:37.041
But what's the message now ?!,00:10:37.041,00:10:39.170
"The message is actually for them
Viewers that this virus is not at all",00:10:39.170,00:10:44.090
as evil as we are told.,00:10:44.090,00:10:47.566
For me now,00:10:47.566,00:10:49.040
"very difficult as a doctor because I 
am here now against ""world opinion"".",00:10:49.040,00:10:55.040
"what is now haunted by the press, by
the media and so on what that",00:10:55.040,00:10:58.750
is stylized.,00:10:58.750,00:11:02.000
"Actually my message is, I call for it",00:11:02.000,00:11:03.260
"Government and the epidemiologists
this world, feet on the ground",00:11:03.260,00:11:08.420
"bring down and admit: love
Folks, let's go back in time",00:11:08.420,00:11:13.190
"look, let's learn from swine flu and SARS and so on what we had!",00:11:13.190,00:11:17.270
And let's educate the population,00:11:17.270,00:11:19.214
that we have a completely harmless flu wave here,00:11:19.214,00:11:21.770
have and nothing more!,00:11:21.770,00:11:23.508
We now have a virus for it,00:11:23.508,00:11:26.240
"blamed that in hard
Cases old patients",00:11:26.240,00:11:31.010
"course can cost life, but
this is also out of proportion",00:11:31.010,00:11:35.660
"the flu that we usually have
to have.",00:11:35.660,00:11:38.074
It’s so sad what,00:11:38.074,00:11:39.830
"is going on in this world right now. If
I imagine that every day",00:11:39.830,00:11:43.400
"really around 20 to 30,000 every day
Children starve to death in this world, like",00:11:43.400,00:11:50.840
"little do we care?
And how much is around this virus now",00:11:50.840,00:11:57.080
"is made of this nasty killer virus what
is basically a staging.",00:11:57.080,00:12:02.120
"As almost every year - and therefore lean
I, as a doctor, look very far out of the window,",00:12:02.120,00:12:07.130
"but I also ask mine
medical colleagues on: coming up again",00:12:07.130,00:12:11.180
down the floor!,00:12:11.180,00:12:12.366
There are surgeries that have plexiglass panels at their reception,00:12:12.366,00:12:16.550
"lock. Doctors who are only on the
Street in spacesuits to go with her",00:12:16.550,00:12:20.750
"influenza sick people
to receive the street - you ask",00:12:20.750,00:12:25.280
"sometimes, they really have medicine
educated?!",00:12:25.280,00:12:28.453
What's really going on ?!,00:12:28.453,00:12:30.320
"But of course it will be through the media, all the news",00:12:30.320,00:12:34.610
that all spreads even more.,00:12:34.610,00:12:36.814
So now I have from,00:12:36.814,00:12:38.450
a message to my brother from Moscow,00:12:38.450,00:12:42.110
get over here in Germany,00:12:42.110,00:12:47.800
"allegedly everyone is infected and that it is
is really bad for us.",00:12:47.800,00:12:53.570
"So that was a message
such a huge number",00:12:53.570,00:12:58.400
and then my brother asks:,00:12:58.400,00:13:02.034
Is that so?,00:13:02.034,00:13:03.380
"and I said I live and I
have no one personally yet.",00:13:03.380,00:13:10.730
"I know a lot of people, the Corona
would test positive, they intended",00:13:10.730,00:13:15.980
"two weeks of her runny nose, one
a little fever and then it was over.",00:13:15.980,00:13:20.120
"So there it goes again
for the tests, who are you testing and",00:13:20.120,00:13:24.890
"how accurate are these tests? 
That is also a big question",00:13:24.890,00:13:27.950
"I would be in everyone
Germany now take blood immediately and",00:13:27.950,00:13:32.720
I would like to find and detect corona antibodies with such a large one,00:13:32.720,00:13:37.010
"Percentage of Corona people
Finding antibodies would be a panic",00:13:37.010,00:13:41.450
"gone anyway. Because they have nothing
they look healthy!",00:13:41.450,00:13:44.661
"And these tests with which we take a throat swab,",00:13:44.661,00:13:45.770
we had swine flu back then,00:13:45.770,00:13:49.490
"the test that only had one
eleven percent hit rate. Yes that means",00:13:49.490,00:13:53.780
"almost 90 percent of the cases that were
wrong tested!",00:13:53.780,00:13:57.817
And now you have over China,00:13:57.817,00:13:59.000
"also found out that
this corona test",00:13:59.000,00:14:03.380
"even a maximum of 30 - 40 percent
Hit rate.",00:14:03.380,00:14:07.630
"When do you become contagious?
That is also a good question!",00:14:07.630,00:14:11.930
Are you just contagious now?,00:14:11.930,00:14:13.552
When I get an infrared thermometer at the airport,00:14:13.552,00:14:16.460
"hold up on the forehead
and now from the masses there",00:14:16.460,00:14:20.330
"look for something shining heads and
pick it out and isolate it",00:14:20.330,00:14:25.100
"for 14 days in the custody,
because they come from the 14 days",00:14:25.100,00:14:29.480
"Clinics are not out and are healthy! You have nothing, maybe one",00:14:29.480,00:14:33.440
"bit elevated temperature and then
that's it.",00:14:33.440,00:14:36.440
"And we sit for 14 days
Isolation stations and thus overload",00:14:36.440,00:14:40.850
"we completely change our health care system because
now we have for the really sick",00:14:40.850,00:14:44.270
"for example, no old people at all
Capacity.",00:14:44.270,00:14:47.897
But how is it actually,00:14:47.897,00:14:49.030
"supposedly someone has this corona and was sick too,",00:14:49.030,00:14:54.790
was quarantined for two weeks ...,00:14:54.790,00:15:01.030
Can this person go out afterwards?,00:15:01.030,00:15:05.980
"At the moment it is no longer
he's through.",00:15:05.980,00:15:10.120
"But he can get it again in the morning, because Corona also has dozens of subtypes.",00:15:10.120,00:15:14.500
He can also get other flu infections with which he may have others,00:15:14.500,00:15:19.230
"immunocompromised people too
infected again. But let's shake it",00:15:19.230,00:15:24.430
"times this contagion fear away ... who
does it get sick ?!",00:15:24.430,00:15:28.960
"That is the most important thing! The Terran is
the crucial!",00:15:28.960,00:15:32.050
"If the viruses were always 100% contagious,",00:15:32.050,00:15:37.540
then it would be justified that I wear a mouthguard and just no hand,00:15:37.540,00:15:40.960
"just don't give up
drink the same cup and not in the",00:15:40.960,00:15:44.020
"sleep the same bed.
When are you contagious when you already are",00:15:44.020,00:15:47.410
Snapped Corona?,00:15:47.410,00:15:49.048
You can take the subway through Munich today,00:15:49.048,00:15:51.190
"drive and snap that and only 14
days later",00:15:51.190,00:15:55.360
"you get a slight fever and a
a bit of a cold. And how many",00:15:55.360,00:15:58.390
"a hundred thousand people in the
Have met in the meantime, shook hands ...",00:15:58.390,00:16:05.320
When do you become infectious?,00:16:05.520,00:16:10.680
"We would have to do that now
insanely top-class experts who",00:16:10.690,00:16:14.050
"Virologists ask them in the end
push around",00:16:14.050,00:16:17.590
"We don't really know exactly and
we appreciate and we can the location",00:16:17.590,00:16:21.790

"Shrugging shoulders and ""we don't know

that our politicians advise.,00:16:29.410,00:16:35.940
"Virologists basically say nothing, they say nothing!
The epidemiologists basically say nothing.",00:16:36.120,00:16:43.280
You just panic. What's really going on outside,00:16:43.360,00:16:46.540
"the doctors should say. We,
resident doctors, we register",00:16:46.540,00:16:51.070
"but we do have case numbers. I
make diagnoses of a flu-like infection.",00:16:51.070,00:16:55.390
That goes to the health insurance company,00:16:55.390,00:16:58.449
"then to the study group
Influenza and then",00:16:58.449,00:17:02.199
would you see,00:17:02.199,00:17:03.351
There is little going on we hardly have a flu this,00:17:03.351,00:17:07.600
"Year because we had no winter!
That would be down to earth.",00:17:07.600,00:17:12.459
That would be honest. We hardly have flu diseases! And what do I do now?,00:17:12.459,00:17:19.149
"with this quarantine measure ?!
What do you want",00:17:19.149,00:17:23.529
"with this purpose ?! Now we lock them
train, people can no longer",00:17:23.529,00:17:27.610
"going to work, the gross national product
completely collapses that",00:17:27.610,00:17:31.210
"Great Depression is inevitable
it costs the whole world tens",00:17:31.210,00:17:35.169
"Billions of euros and dollars.
And who benefits from it in the end ?!",00:17:35.169,00:17:40.200
That's the big question! The pharmaceutical industry is now getting subsidies like the one at,00:17:40.400,00:17:45.460
"Swine flu at the time,
government-supported, very quickly",00:17:45.460,00:17:48.760
"Swine flu vaccine on the market
to throw, which in the end nobody wants.",00:17:48.760,00:17:52.620
And now it's the Corona Virus vaccine.,00:17:52.620,00:17:55.419
Now 100 volunteers are to be tested soon.,00:17:55.419,00:17:59.350
At that time we still had the Tamiflu,00:17:59.350,00:18:01.539
"high in the race. There was also the
Pressure from the pharmaceutical industry on the",00:18:01.539,00:18:05.080
"Politicians great: if you don't now
Tamiflu will buy in huge quantities, then",00:18:05.080,00:18:09.760
there is a supply shortage and we can for,00:18:09.760,00:18:12.850
"your people, dear state
whole medication no longer available",00:18:12.850,00:18:16.419

So they definitely benefit",00:18:16.420,00:18:19.580

"they can’t really do that anymore
agree with their conscience what they are there",00:18:44.380,00:18:48.490
"have started.
There is no more rowing back because admitting that to yourself.",00:18:48.490,00:18:54.300
that would be real size.,00:18:54.400,00:18:56.980
Admit to yourself where we really ended up.,00:18:57.180,00:19:00.880
"No, that's only possible afterwards
In a week or two",00:19:00.880,00:19:04.830
"the flu wave over. Like in China
we can already see it now",00:19:04.830,00:19:09.419
"The Chinese now have 65 million
caged people in their cities,",00:19:09.419,00:19:13.890
"but that doesn't mean that
don't go underground too,",00:19:13.890,00:19:17.860
And how quickly there is the infection,00:19:17.860,00:19:20.159
"there is. If you do this now
65 million Chinese detained",00:19:20.159,00:19:24.299

"all of this corona virus and most
had no symptoms whatsoever!",00:19:28.799,00:19:33.029
"And then suddenly this whole thing would be
Staging a nonsense. Just like SARS.",00:19:33.029,00:19:41.120
In the aftermath we could,00:19:41.280,00:19:45.600
"learn from it, study very similarly to the",00:19:45.600,00:19:49.380

still different, just where everything",00:20:17.250,00:20:21.929
"so closes the planes flying
not the whole countries are closing",00:20:21.929,00:20:26.760

never had. I know people who",00:20:26.760,00:20:32.250

have to cancel their events.",00:20:32.250,00:20:38.120

go",00:20:42.700,00:20:45.616

then you see the opposite,",00:21:31.740,00:21:35.300
