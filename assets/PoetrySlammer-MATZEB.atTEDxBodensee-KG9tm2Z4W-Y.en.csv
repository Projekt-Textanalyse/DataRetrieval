Klaus Reichert: I'm already very excited.,00:00:15.141,00:00:17.728
"We have invited Matze B.,
Matthias Brenner, here from Kreuzlingen,",00:00:17.728,00:00:22.313
"whom I would like
to warmly welcome to the stage.",00:00:22.313,00:00:25.101
(Applause),00:00:25.386,00:00:27.803
Matze B.: Okay.,00:00:27.808,00:00:28.948
"So, first of all, I'm sorry
that I'm the only one here",00:00:30.506,00:00:33.504
not to speak with a fancy headset.,00:00:33.504,00:00:36.791
There's a simple reason for that:,00:00:36.791,00:00:39.178
"Since my texts mostly have
a dynamic that bursts out a little,",00:00:39.178,00:00:43.212
I need to have the possibility,00:00:43.212,00:00:45.297
to draw back with my voice.,00:00:45.297,00:00:47.455
"I thought, even though
it's getting towards the end,",00:00:48.385,00:00:51.859
"I'd start with a little
get-to-know-you game.",00:00:51.859,00:00:54.345
I learnt it during a management workshop.,00:00:54.345,00:00:56.736
It's very simple.,00:00:56.736,00:00:58.766
"I count to three, and then everyone
says their name, okay?",00:00:58.766,00:01:01.677
"Right, so: one, two, three: Matze.",00:01:01.682,00:01:06.271
Great.,00:01:06.271,00:01:07.474
"So now we know each other, we can start.",00:01:07.474,00:01:11.507
"Well, I'm no businessman,",00:01:11.857,00:01:14.508
at least not a successful one.,00:01:15.018,00:01:16.986
(Laughter),00:01:16.986,00:01:18.275
"I'm also not a visionary
in any strict sense of the term.",00:01:19.228,00:01:22.591
I've no big idea,00:01:22.591,00:01:24.365
"with which to make
the world a better place.",00:01:24.365,00:01:26.900
And naturally TED[x] attendees here,00:01:26.900,00:01:30.254
will be asking two questions:,00:01:30.254,00:01:33.603
Why him?,00:01:33.813,00:01:35.307
And what the hell is a poetry slam?,00:01:37.059,00:01:40.232
"I will try to briefly answer
the second question,",00:01:40.232,00:01:43.418
"or if possible, answer so that the first
question is maybe forgotten.",00:01:43.418,00:01:47.967
"A poetry slam is a modern poetry contest,",00:01:49.815,00:01:52.970
"it was started in the 80s in Chicago
by Mark Kelley Smith,",00:01:52.975,00:01:56.500
a former builder or draughtsman.,00:01:56.505,00:01:59.243
He couldn't accept the fact,00:02:00.291,00:02:01.975
"that poetry, poems, lyrics,
spoken literature",00:02:01.975,00:02:06.343
"are only performed
in a 'water-glass reading' scenario:",00:02:06.343,00:02:09.659
"A table, an older gentleman
and a glass of water, and then,",00:02:09.660,00:02:14.831
"""I will read from my cycle 'Blue'
the fifth poem 'Cobalt'.""",00:02:15.458,00:02:20.818
"He wanted to get away from that,",00:02:23.524,00:02:26.159
"and said, ""'We need slam poetry.""",00:02:26.159,00:02:28.353
"""Slam"", a term used in sport;",00:02:28.353,00:02:30.402
"it should be zappy, it should be punchy,
it should cut through.",00:02:31.411,00:02:35.374
"We want it removed
from ivory tower posturing",00:02:35.387,00:02:38.813
"and the ""I'm an intellectual.""",00:02:38.813,00:02:41.181
"We'll do it in local clubs, squats,",00:02:41.181,00:02:43.545
"on the road, no matter where -
somewhere where things move.",00:02:43.545,00:02:46.685
And that was the idea.,00:02:46.685,00:02:48.305
"Something very central to poetry slam:
there's no expert jury.",00:02:48.305,00:02:51.829
"So it's not like X-Factor
or Britain's Got Talent,",00:02:51.829,00:02:55.250
"where they have experts
saying things like,",00:02:55.250,00:02:58.432
"""I'm not sure about that.",00:02:58.432,00:03:01.055
"You didn't get the iambs
in the third line quite right,""",00:03:01.055,00:03:06.093
"but rather the audience,
the people listening, are the jury.",00:03:07.140,00:03:11.648
"The audience form an unelected jury,",00:03:11.648,00:03:15.045
"and they get a scoreboard
like in figure skating.",00:03:15.045,00:03:18.664
A ten is for a poem,00:03:18.664,00:03:21.294
"that triggers a spontaneous
collective orgasm in the room,",00:03:21.294,00:03:25.258
and a zero is for a poem,00:03:25.258,00:03:27.482
that should never have been written.,00:03:27.487,00:03:30.436
You got the verb tense. Right?,00:03:31.434,00:03:34.359
"So that's how slam started,",00:03:36.544,00:03:39.250
and there are only token prizes.,00:03:39.250,00:03:41.502
"There's really nothing to win,
except a bottle of rum and some honor,",00:03:41.507,00:03:45.958
"or a whisky and knock it back,
as is more usually the case.",00:03:47.156,00:03:50.796
"You just get a bottle
of whisky, and that's it.",00:03:50.796,00:03:54.322
"There are three rules in poetry slam,",00:03:54.830,00:03:56.934
and they're quite simple.,00:03:56.938,00:03:58.478
The first rule is:,00:03:58.481,00:03:59.956
it must be a self-written text.,00:03:59.965,00:04:02.866
The choice of genre is totally free.,00:04:02.869,00:04:05.051
That's something I really like about slam.,00:04:05.051,00:04:07.320
"You're not tied
to any particular text form.",00:04:07.320,00:04:09.504
"You can recite whatever you want
as long as it's your own work.",00:04:09.504,00:04:13.363
So I can't recite the work of another poet,00:04:14.073,00:04:16.397
"like Schiller, Schwitters,
or Tupac Shakur;",00:04:16.397,00:04:22.186
it must be mine.,00:04:22.186,00:04:23.597
The second rule is: no props.,00:04:23.602,00:04:25.662
I think I'm obeying that today.,00:04:25.662,00:04:28.456
"So no props, no costumes,
no masks, no instruments,",00:04:28.456,00:04:33.815
no animals or relatives on stage.,00:04:33.815,00:04:37.085
"There should ultimately really
just be the poet, his text,",00:04:37.466,00:04:40.244
"the written script
and the microphone there.",00:04:40.244,00:04:43.792
And the third rule,00:04:43.792,00:04:45.324
- and this one is much like with TED[x] -,00:04:45.329,00:04:47.865
is that there is a time limit.,00:04:47.873,00:04:49.540
The texts are normally limited,00:04:49.863,00:04:51.675
to somewhere between five and ten minutes.,00:04:51.680,00:04:55.259
"Five minutes, so doing the maths,",00:04:56.117,00:04:59.288
it means I can do three texts.,00:04:59.288,00:05:01.830
"So, enough to put me to the test.",00:05:02.170,00:05:05.751
"Right, that's all about slam,
that was slam.",00:05:07.278,00:05:10.632
What's actually really important -,00:05:11.196,00:05:13.279
"or what's really important
for me personally",00:05:13.284,00:05:15.478
"is the cathartic experience,",00:05:15.483,00:05:17.196
"the direct communication
with the audience.",00:05:17.196,00:05:19.893
"I really do get an instant reply,",00:05:19.893,00:05:22.680
"and sometimes it's not
so nice, on the stage.",00:05:22.680,00:05:27.243
"Here in Konstanz,
where I started slamming,",00:05:27.672,00:05:30.519
the audience is particularly well known,00:05:30.519,00:05:32.388
to be very frank with you.,00:05:32.395,00:05:33.875
"So if someone starts getting bored,
they start snapping their fingers,",00:05:33.875,00:05:37.195
"and that can really get on your nerves,",00:05:37.195,00:05:39.084
"or they yell, boo, and so on.",00:05:39.089,00:05:43.065
"So all sorts of positive
and negative reaction.",00:05:43.070,00:05:47.045
"The advantage for me as a poet
is really that I have direct feedback:",00:05:47.390,00:05:51.144
"What's the problem? How can I change it?
How can I work on the text?",00:05:51.155,00:05:55.918
"So, some introductory words on:
What is poetry slam?",00:05:56.860,00:06:00.792
"Perhaps with the 'E' in TED,
'entertainment',",00:06:00.792,00:06:04.705
is where I fit in a bit.,00:06:04.705,00:06:07.712
"So I'd like to start very briefly
with my first text.",00:06:09.299,00:06:12.906
"It is a very short text,",00:06:12.911,00:06:14.621
"it's to do with my part
of the country, my origins.",00:06:15.425,00:06:19.035
It goes like this:,00:06:21.797,00:06:23.228
(South German dialect) No.,00:06:25.720,00:06:27.807
"No, I'm not from here.",00:06:28.495,00:06:30.601
"Well, where are you from then?",00:06:32.061,00:06:34.234
"(Standard German) Well, I'm
the son of my father.",00:06:34.330,00:06:36.668
"(South German Dialect)Yeah, of my father,",00:06:36.673,00:06:38.635
"the son of Ernst Brenner,
Bernhard Brenner, his lad.",00:06:38.641,00:06:41.521
"Oh, yes; you've grown.",00:06:41.950,00:06:44.828
"(Standard German) Talk tends to go
something like that back home in Nagold.",00:06:45.822,00:06:49.609
"Today, it's clear to me
why I started to read.",00:06:49.799,00:06:53.310
"Nagold, oh woody village,
your meadows of never lusher field,",00:06:54.371,00:06:59.005
"where birds sing and flowers upward yield,",00:06:59.498,00:07:02.707
"where the Bambi deer
are by hunters keeled,",00:07:03.136,00:07:06.044
"and the ground shakes
as field guns fire zealed.",00:07:06.044,00:07:10.035
"Here, I wish to die, but never live.",00:07:11.299,00:07:14.688
Just a short idea of how it goes.,00:07:17.529,00:07:20.043
(Applause),00:07:20.043,00:07:22.632
"Thank you, thank you.",00:07:22.871,00:07:25.137
"So that was about my part of the country,",00:07:29.374,00:07:31.460
my origin in Nagold - beautiful.,00:07:31.460,00:07:33.974
Perhaps you'll come by one day.,00:07:33.974,00:07:35.815
"Right, the second text
that I've prepared for you",00:07:36.649,00:07:39.712
"is perhaps my only, my greatest -",00:07:40.521,00:07:44.654
my only hit.,00:07:46.036,00:07:47.741
"And it deals with what
I think, many students",00:07:49.593,00:07:52.918
"there will be many people among you
who need to write on the computer",00:07:52.918,00:07:58.272
who will know the problem.,00:07:59.156,00:08:00.596
